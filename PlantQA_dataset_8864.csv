229291,t3_o4ltt2,"I forgot I was sprouting mango pits but my eldritch horrors - I mean mangos - sprouted. Enthusiastically. Um. Do I stick just the tentacles, er, roots, in the soil, with them being this spouted? Or do I bury the whole thing (in an unmarked grave and never speak of this incident again)?","I did this before and um... they looked almost that bad. I would stick them in some dirt, they'll eventually figure out they're plants."

137687,t3_jdfbrr,My African violet has been blooming so long I have forgotten when it wasn't blooming. It has gotten quite large and lower leaves die. Is it possible to divide it?,All I know is that it’s very easy to take those lower leaves and propagate new plants.
109866,t3_i5owwt,Update: THANK YOU! My Monstera is back to its' monstrous self. As soon as I repotted without gravel it grew six new leaves in four days?,"My monstera hasn’t grown a new leaf in weeks, almost a month. Any tips??? 😄"
142760,t3_jmloxj,My Aloe Vera has spontaneously duplicated itself. Should I repot one of them? Will the roots survive?,Definitely repot one. They’re pretty hardy as long as you give them plenty of room. I’ve been repotting runners from one single plant for the last 5 years. I’m up to over 50 plants from that one.
165463,t3_kvtz9w,Should I repot this succulent? I got it about 6 months ago and it’s growing like crazy. He’s got long tendrils and some of them are sending out roots. Is he ok to stay in this planter or should I move him to something bigger?,"It looks fine to me, sedum likes to have somewhat constricted roots. I'd say you have 6 months to a year before it'll need to be repotted"
214362,t3_nd4pwl,My Monstera got a little bit root bound (I had to break the pot to free her!) I hope she settles in well to her new home. Do you think her new pot size looks ok?,[deleted]
152510,t3_k4rhw3,"Scored this huge split leaf something or other at Home Depot for only 75 bucks, now I just need to not kill it. Help please! Tips? What can I do to make this monster get even bigger?",These keep showing up and I love them. The more direct light they get the more fertilizer and water they'll need. The more light the more leaves it will push out hence why it needs to be fertilized more often. I have mine in a south facing window and I get roughly 3 leaves a month. I recommend staking it or it will continue to grow wide. They're overall pretty easy to tell what they need. They are toxic to humans and pets so if you do prune leaves make sure you wash your hands. They have a distinct smell.
84697,t3_h9lg23,"Money tree growing well, I would like to know when would be a good time to transfer into a bigger container?","So pretty! Idk why they’re always sold braided, they look so much better like this. And if it’s still growing and looking happy I wouldn’t repot yet, unless roots are growing out of the bottom or something"
173790,t3_lb4o46,Issues in the long run? Got bored with the lockdown so I started messing around with my plants again. I made a plant support ring and wrapped the vine around it since it was getting a bit long. It’s cute and all but I’m worried if this will stunt the growth or damage it in the long run...?,"i think as long as you didn't attach the vines with staples (which some plant stores do), it should be fine. adansonii are trailing climbing plants so it should continue to grow."
98819,t3_hshl8c,My ZZ has had a TON of new growth over the past few weeks (light green). Is it in duress or just happy? Should I repot?,"It's grow time, she's happy!"

122994,t3_iokq24,"There’s nothing particularly *wrong* with my Monstera (aside from being a lil crispy from her outdoor isolation after The Thrips Incident), but she has only sprouted one new leaf and otherwise hasn’t really grown at all since I got her in May.

182547,t3_lrh2jk,"Got this from my wonderful bf for valentines, do I just put it in water and pray for roots? What's the best way to propogate it?","Wow, what a gift!"
150297,t3_k01ogx,My Ctenanthe Grey Star is flourishing with hundreds of leaves up to 45cm long. This one was nestled in amongst them - any ideas? Just confused?,Maybe what you have is a hybrid and a random mutation changed it so it shows its parent leaf. the changed half looks like a  calathea compact star
158666,t3_khr1cu,"my monstera is dying! she’s been in the same soil for 4 years, so i think it needs to be repotted. how do i repot this baby without breaking her/making a huge mess?",Make the mess. Clean it up afterwards.

240986,t3_op0zcd,"Is my peace lily okay? From my grandma’s funeral so I want it to live forever, but there’s like a double-barrel bloom and an all-green bloom?","Copied from google…. Peace lilies prefer low light conditions and thrive in areas where they receive filtered light. When peace lilies get too much light, the blooms turn green. This occurs because the plant performs more photosynthesis in stronger light and the green pigment in the flowers show through."
177199,t3_lhpacm,Should I be worried about the yellowing on tips of Buddha’s temple and the dried up bits at the bottom?,"I wouldn’t be too worried as it may just be leaves making space for more stem/ thicker leaves at the base- but I’m not too sure- half small advice, half commenting for visibility for your post"
306634,t3_tfsy35,"😭 went on vacation and my thermostat broke- over 100 degrees in my house for a couple days! these are just some of the causalities, any advice?",Oh no! I’m so sorry ! I see the saddest face In The background there 😩
198634,t3_mlmb4p,My tradescantia started blooming. Will this inhibit the growth of the plant? Should I pluck them off?,"I would just leave it, they are fast growers even when flowering."
65050,t3_g79m09,"my local nursery had this bad boy for 16$, I think he needs a bigger pot, and the leaves are pretty crispy, how do I nurse him back to health?","Honestly looks pretty good as is from the picture. Bigger pot is a definite with some good potting soil. Other than that, bright, indirect light and a good watering schedule that keeps the soil evenly moist. If you are feeling ambitious, wrap a short post or board (couple feet tall) with sphagnum moss and this guy will climb up it to make what they call a totem."
236922,t3_oi2o4t,Just got this variegated Monstera in the mail. Do you think I should put it in water or put it in soil?,"I'd go for soil! It might take a while to start growing, keep that in mind, so whenever the root system seems good and healthy, it's straight to a nice crunchy and airy soil, with some nutriments!"
126773,t3_iujasi,Is this because its out growing the plant? Should I break a large chunk of it off and repot the aloe?,"Damn I bet there is not even any dirt in that pot, just massive roots!"
159263,t3_kj75ls,HELP! After a summer of neglect my Buddha’s temple looks.... like this. Is the bottom dead? Is there anything I can do for it?,It's very alive just a little dehydrated. I personally think it looks fine just needs to return to a regular watering schedule
43482,t3_enredm,"After years taking up space on my patio, my Pineapple has grown a fruit. What’s this little guy growing underneath the fruit?","That is a second pineapple, referred to as a pup with bromeliads! Just let it grow, and be careful when removing the more mature fruit to not damage the pup!

Congrats on a SUPER healthy plant for it to be making babies."
248174,t3_p1ed0m,"I'm taking over as a school librarian, and the library has a couple plants. The previous librarian said that all I need to do is water them once a week.

242552,t3_orl3v7,"My dog knocked over my Pilea in attempt to once and for all, end the mailman. Any tips on how to repot/regrow?","Pull a few stems off the bottom and put it in water.  It should root eventually.   Once nice roots form, back in the soil!"
64359,t3_g627xp,"Anybody have an idea why my strawberry begonia is all tentacle, with no babies? She even has a tentacle that branches into multiple tentacles.. am I raising a monster?","This  is one of my favourite plants I own. It will send out those runners, and then little new plants will start appearing. It’ll start to make them in no time, don’t worry! Also, a lot of people believe this is a Begonia, but it’s actually called Saxifraga stolonifera, not even in the same family as Begonia! It’s leaf shape just resemble a Begonia."
298170,t3_sp7ng6,"Back in the office full time and dealing with some neglected office plants. Obviously going to repot this philodendron, but should I bury these aerial roots or leave them out when I do?","Not a Philodendron.  This is a Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum.  You can leave the aerial roots the way they are, trim them off, or bury them.  Just don't bury the trunk any deeper."
28413,t3_d2a1yb,"30 year old or so rosemary cascade starting to wither and break despite diligent care, wondering if perhaps we’ve reached the end of it’s life cycle?","Wow!

225732,t3_nxzbut,"my zz plants been dead for the past 7 months, thought of throwing it out this week but change of plans! any tips or ways I could help this guy out?","I would remove this and pot into a smaller pot if it ""died"" most of that root mass has probably died too so it will die for real if you leave it in that pot and water as normal."

76620,t3_gqwel5,Found this monster in the alley behind my apartment. Once I'm sure it doesn't have any pests I'll bring it inside. What should I know about caring for this guy? Can I trim off some of the crispy brown ends or should I leave them all?,Where the hell do all you people live where you just find these amazing plants on the streets?! I’m so jealous!
270229,t3_qagvus,"I’m receiving this v. monstera albo in a plant bundle, is there going to be any way to save him? or is it too white and bound to die?","I'd probably stick him under a grow light just to get as much light as he needs with the little chlorophyll that he has. Rooting for you tho I hope he makes it!

Edit: I'd probably think about cutting off the one pure white leaf as it will die off anyway and it's just using up energy that the plant could use to push out new leaves instead"
180441,t3_lnqqw4,Victor is about to flower but all his mouths are shut without feeding... anyone seen this or knows why?,"He hasn’t been eating for a month or so, I was trying to feed his some meal bugs today to help compensating some nutrition since he’s flowering and I noticed his mouths are all closed.  There’s one half close mouth so I try to tigger the little hairs but no response...Zone 9, He’s regularly bottom chugged with distilled water every 4-5 days, in full sun during daytime and indoor at night, never had any health issue."
279527,t3_r2p4lz,"My wandering Jew grew very rapidly and seems happy overall, however it has a lot of thinning at the beginning of her vines. Is this normal? Is there something I can do to make her happier?","It is normal they are really great with trims. You could do a bunch but it looks so good I would cut a strand to prop ( they prop in water very easily) and you could plant back in after rooting, all while promoting new growth from the base."
353683,t3_x86kvd,I grow avocados trees from avocados I buy. This one seems to be an albino plant. I’ve looked up albino avocado trees &amp; apparently they will not survive long. Are the green specks enough for the plant to collect nutrients? Should I even risk planting it once it is mature enough or keep it in water?,Probably will die on its own. But if you try grafting it on another avocado that does have green leaves might allow it to grow more. Just like those red and yellow cactus at the stores.
101856,t3_hvrfe1,"I’ve had this guy for two years (my oldest plant) and never repotted him. Seems to be getting crowded in there though, should I try repotting?","I personally think it’s fine! If he was unhappy you would know. He seems really healthy! 

If you do choose to repot, wrap a good amount of newspaper around the cactus and gently tug it out of the container. This way you don’t poke yourself! Since it’s been in that pot for so long the roots may be pretty tight in there and you may need to break the pot to get it out- it looks like it’s plastic so I would suggest laying the cactus on its side and carefully cutting away the pot."
362847,t3_y3btsd,RIP my sanity. I was checking a pothos with a couple of yellowing leaves and found SPIDER MITES 😭 Checking my other plants and I've found some on almost all of them. (Whole gang not pictured here) Any tips??,Pesticide or beneficial predators. Don't bother with anything else. Personally I used bifenthrin with great results after just one spray.
314232,t3_u4os1t,HELP! My dog ripped off the bottom part so of my Rhaphidophora Tetrasperma’s stem so it no longer has roots. How can I re-root it and save the left half?,I mean I think your only choice is to propagate it. I would personally get a bottle that fits there on top of the soil so you dont have to shock the plant by moving it off it’s trellis. Then just make sure the water is full in the bottle and it should root. Once you have more roots you can slide the left side down the trellis to get your roots into the dirt. :/ i dont know but I think you may lose a leaf or two like this but it’s all I can think of
199637,t3_mncbfn,My monstera has had sad leaves since I got him months ago. Other than that he seems happy with two new beautiful leaves.

220265,t3_no7cex,"1 year old chilli plant, not flowering/fruiting. Only had one chilli 8months ago. What am I doing wrong?",Sun through a window is not nearly intense enough for most vegetables- it needs prolonged direct sun or grow lights.

195170,t3_mfo9aj,I was away from home for 2 weeks and vastly underestimated how much my poor Fittonia would dehydrate. Is it a lost cause??,"Definitely not a lost cause! As long as it hasn't turned brown and dried up, it can still recover once watered.

I've got a Peace Lily that took a full week of looking dead before it finally decided to wake up again so don't give up hope just yet 😊"
55896,t3_fnlk8l,"I noticed she was root bound and split her up and gave new soil, so I guess that makes me the asshole?","Please forgive me if this sounds rude or accusing, but... are there a bunch of plants clumped together and potted in the middle of the planter? I read your comment with the details of the situation. Assuming that this is several small plants, as pothos generally are, they should be planted throughout the pot and not just in the middle. There needs to be ventilation among the stalks and each plant needs its own space. You essentially plant each one separately in the pot, not together.  

If it sounds like I'm assessing this accurately and/or you happen to be new at potting plants, I'm more than happy to help you out. I'm a certified master gardener, so volunteering my time to assist other gardeners is what I do. I could take photos of my stock or of me repotting a pothos, whatever helps. I raise pothos and other plants, then sell them, so I'm prepared for a situation like this."

Maybe one other in the back (shiny, broad green leaves?) but I am not sure.

You should separate all the plants into their own pots, though! They are all fairly easy to care for, but do have slightly different light/water requirements."
79745,t3_gvsdru,Working on getting this schefflera to grow it’s roots into the lava rock. So far a lot of roots but more so into the water and not the rock. Tips?,You need to do this is soil.

It’s often totally fine and the roots look very healthy so I wouldn’t worry. Gently remove the old soil as much as you can but don’t stress. Heads up BoP get traumatized from repotting sometimes so be patient...it’ll be okay in time!
302446,t3_t2vq6g,How should I repot this spider plant? I purchased a week ago and noticed it needed to be repotted but didn’t realize how bound up it was. How should I repot without harming the roots?,"Honestly you can just pop it in a new pot as is. The roots will make their own way. I've found my spider plants go crazy in the root department and usually get close to that when I repot them. 

In the past, I have taken similar ones and just soaked them in water while I prepared the new pot and soil so that's an option. It will loosen any roots that will want to loosen. Otherwise I wouldn't stress about it."

216825,t3_nhvqov,Reposting because I didn’t get any response the first time. My ZZ plant was stuck in my office without water or light for a couple months during lockdown. It’s been home with me for a year now but the leaves have remained dull and curled like this since I brought it home. Any insight?,are you watering it adequately? this plant looks dehydrated. ZZ's only need to be watered when the soil is completely dry but when you *do* water it you should fully saturate the soil so much that the water freely runs out of the drainage hole at the bottom.
78765,t3_gu27jw,"My string of turtles is pushing out a bunch of new growth, but last year's growth is very opaque and yellowish. Is there something wrong with it or is this normal?","In my experience, yellowish growth means too much water. I don’t have that specific plant, but that looks like a water-retaining leaf, so too much watering on your part could lead to over saturation."

350792,t3_wzbnox,Help! My mom gave me this plant and I have no idea what it’s name is or how to help it. It hasn’t grown in the 6+ months I’ve had it. Can it be saved?? Does anyone know what this is?,"It's a Dracaena. 

It is extremely over-potted and allowed to get entirely too tall. Tell mom, with friends like this, you don't need enemies! 🤣

You need to do some drastic surgery on mom's ""gift""! 

First, find an unglazed terracotta pot that is no larger than 6 inches - 4 inches would be ideal.

Next, extricate that poor baby from that huge pot and start checking the roots. Trim away any roots that look dead - most will probably fall off if you give them a good shower.

Now, the fun part. Once you have her out of the pot and have confirmed you still have healthy roots, cut the top off at the first bend in the trunk, right where that curled brown leaf is pointing. 

Prepare a small pot for the cutting (4"" unglazed terracotta). A 50-50 mix of perlite and potting soil is perfect for Dracaena cuttings and rooting. Keep it in a shady location and keep the soil **slightly damp.** Keep a close eye on it, since you do not want the soil to dry out completely, but you must make 100% sure, it is never sopping wet. It will root in 4-6 weeks.

Second fun part: Now chop that trunk down, leaving about 2-3 inches at the bottom. Get your first little pot and plant it in there. Same 50-50 mix is great for Dracaenas. They cannot stand being waterlogged. 

It should start sprouting new growth from the trunk.

If you want to have more fun, chop the leftover trunk into 4"" pieces and lay them **flat** on top of the same 50-50 mix. Mist them and add a very small amount of the mix on top of them. You want to see part of the stem, resting on its side. 

Put a dome over the cuttings (or a clear, lightweight plastic bag), but allow some air to get in there. **LIGHTLY** mist them when the top soil is dry to touch. These take longer to root and not always 100% successful.

OK. That's it! Have fun! :)"
236185,t3_ogt4xn,Noticed these sac-like bubbly things on my cactus today. I think they weren't there yesterday. I prickled them with a toothpick and despite their looks they're pretty rigid and don't fall off. Is my plant sick? What are these things?,So after a quick Google search theses looks like green shield bugs eggs.

86340,t3_hc02n2,My mom passed away and my step dad isn’t a plant person. Any ideas of what may have gone wrong here? I’m assuming the brown just needs to be taken out and repot the small new growth?,"I'd like to make a suggestion... I apologize sincerely if it's unwelcome. First of all, I'm real sorry to hear about your mama. I hope y'all are alright moving forward. 

Here's my recommendation...

Take out all the dry growth, burn it, and add the ashes to a new healthy plant. The plant will be grateful for the carbon addition and your mama will live on through a beautiful, healthy, new plant. Go ahead and try to save the green, but just in case it doesn't make it, this plant will have a new life assisting another healthy plant, just like your mama assisted *you,* her healthy child. 💕

Edit: only do this if you can do it safely, far away from anybody's breathing room. As another commenter mentioned, this particular plant can be very toxic when touched or (one would assume) inhaled."
283412,t3_rflxe7,Help! I’m repotting a pothos at my work and discovered someone put a pot inside of a pot inside of a pot!!! Should I try and remove the inner pot or just replant as is??,"Oh man.

11796,t3_bpzbkp,"Real missed opportunity to call this sub plantparenthood. Also, is there any way to revive my sad succulents?","First step is sunlight. They need vastly more light than they're getting. 

After that... they're probably going to be fine. Don't water too much, they love to be dry. Wait until the bottom leaves get a little soft, then give them a good drink. 

Do the pots they're in drain? If so, perfect. If not... you'll probably want to repot into some that do. Succulents *can* grow in pots with no drainage, but getting the watering just right can be tricky when you can't tell if there's standing water or not. 

How long does the soil stay moist? If it's more than a few days, you'll want to try to find a better draining soil mix (you can usually just add some perlite or something to a normal potting mix). 

The main thing needed here is light. If they've been in darkness for a while, dont put them in full light right away, you'll probably need to work them up to full light (to avoid sun damage- it's very easy for plants to get burned after they've been in the dark)."
153976,t3_k7v125,I was *gently* wiping down Doug my FLF with a microfiber cloth and the healthiest looking leaf feel off. He was a plant I saved from a scale infestation so he’s been through a lot. Could the leaf falling off so easily be a sign of another issue?,"Well that depends actually, cuz with these guys shedding a leaf can actually be a really good thing. If the leaf was down near the bottom, then that means it's actually preparing to bark up and start growing more. My mom's just started doing this, where it dropped like five bottom leaves (it's actually like three or four plants all in the same pot) and then they're going through a growth spurt for no reason

So assuming it was at the bottom, I would try and take that as a sign of something good to come"

They just look underwatered and a little sunburned, if you water them properly and give them time, they will grow new leaves and look as good as new.

All of them are starting to get roots and I couldn't be happier, any tips for potting them?","Don’t leave them in the water too long or they’ll have a hard time transitioning to soil. Once you’ve got a good inch of strong white root you can plant them. I would also cut up that stem- cut on either side of any nodes that have a leaf. Then once you’ve got roots plant them all together in one pot. 

To avoid future root rot I suggest planting in a plastic pot with good drainage. You can place that inside a slightly bigger decorative pot if you want to. That way you can take the plastic pot out and water throughly, give it a good soak and the. Make sure it drains well. Makes everything a lot easier!"

I know the brown/bare areas won’t come back but what should I do with the branches that are half alive? Anyway to stimulate more growth?,"I got a Norfolk Pine in a similar condition from a friend about two years ago (it’s about 1/3 - 1/2 the size). This was one of my first plants ever so I didn’t really know what I was doing and there was some trial and error. The first year I kept all the branches that were brown or half brown / half green hoping they’d come back to life lol. Eventually the branches that were half green turned all brown. Nothing else turned brown but there was also no new growth. I ended up cutting the dead branches off over a few weeks (I read cutting more than 20% off at a time would send the plant into shock) and moved the plant away from the vent (also read this is bad for Norfolk Pines), next to an east facing window. I began watering it a little more than normal and put some coffee grinds on the top, and after a week or two I started to get some new growth! Surprisingly it seems that it being next to a vent was the biggest issue. Since then I’ve gone back to watering it about once every two weeks and it’s continued to grow steadily. I would cut off the dead branches, give it some fertilizer and extra water and put it somewhere it can grow vertically. Im definitely no plant expert still but I hope this is helpful - good luck!"

There's one species that eats them and then dies, and there's another that goes into torpor and awakens again if the mites come back. 

Phytoseiulus persimilis only hatches over 60% humidity. If you're under that just go with P. californicus or P. longipes. Californicus is the one that keeps going and goes into torpor."

If it’s a jumping spider that has taken up residence then you should consider yourself lucky.  They are the cutest little bug murderers you ever saw. It also means there is enough food for them near your plant to take up residence.  
The worst thing that can happen if you let it stay is that it will eat all the nuisance bugs in your house."

Orchids are unusual when it comes to care. They grow up in trees instead of down in the earth, so their roots like to feel a surprising amount of air around them. Most orchids, including this one, are improperly planted. Google ""orchid pot"" and you'll see what I mean.. They like to breathe. You may want to consider replanting it, if it shows signs of overwatering (yellowing leaves, looking soggy, etc.) 

On the same note, invest in a little spray bottle and spray the roots once every day or two days or so. The orchid has special aerial roots that are designed to grab moisture from the air! 

The flowers on top will die one day, and that's ok! You can still care for it until it gets a new flower stalk.

What I would check out is the browning of the tips on the aerial roots. Most likely it will stop on its own. It could have been some change in the environment that caused the velamen on the tips to dry out and turn brown. I would not cut them off at this point in time.

108687,t3_i454gm,Is this root rot? My Pilea accidentally stayed in pretty wet soil for too long before I noticed. How do I go from here?,"Root rot is typically black and soft, so if any of it pulls off easily, it's got to go. If there's no rot anywhere, or you've taken it off, you can then try soaking some of the water up with paper towels, tampons, or a fan.

316631,t3_ublbnu,I cut off a rotting tree branch and it looks like this. Is this heart rot? Anything I can do to help? There’s also moss growing on other branches is this of concern?,"It's called heartwood, it's fine, it's just old wood that no longer has any vascular function.  High quality furniture and other wood products are made from heartwood, it's high in anti-fungal compounds.

Now in the second pic, you have an unhealed knot.  The moss is no issue.  But the open wound there is an invitation to insects and moisture, which means fungus.  You could want to clean out any rotten wood in there, perhaps spray some antifungal like copper naphthenate.  Do NOT try to fill the cavity with wood putty or concrete.  You want it to dry out.  Don't go overboard with any antifungal topical applications, that's not normal arboricultural practice.

There are injectable tree treatments, but that's highly specialized, and it's mostly a treatment of last resort.

You could saw cut back the extended branch bark collar an inch or so, but that's kinda just restarting the healing process from square one.  One unorthodox thing to do is to drill a 1"" diameter hole in the bottom of that stub to help drain any water that might collect in there.  Wouldn't hurt to do that.

You could also just leave it completely alone, just make sure the overall health of the tree is good, with water and fertilizer.

Be on the lookout for any [conchs](https://bugwoodcloud.org/images/768x512/2121089.jpg) or other fungal-mushroomy looking things.  If those appear, you have a big problem, often meaning removal of the tree.

edit: don't use wound paint or bituminous ""tree wound"" compounds, they don't work that well.  

I've toyed with the idea of using a practice from bonsai that preserves old exposed wood. It's called ""jinning"" and you use a lime-sulfur-ash paste to kill fungus.  That's all I know about it, and I've never done it, but it sure works on old bonsai."
328016,t3_v69jlf,Why is my monstera growing like this? All leaf growth on a single branch. Any way to encourage more branches?,"1: Not a Monstera actually! This is Rhaphidiphora tetrasperma.  
2: Plants like this tend to grow from a primary growth point, and are often sold potted with other individual plants to make a more full final product. The best way to encourage them to branch is through pruning back the growth point, which will cause one of the lower buds to assume the new role as leader. Sometimes it then branches.

Bonide Systemic Houseplant Insect Control is the only thing that worked for me. You can supplement with yellow sticky traps to catch any lingering adults.

I tried so many things. Nematodes, mosquito bits, mosquito dunks, watering with hydrogen peroxide, Neem oil, bottom watering, not watering my plants, diatomaceous earth, cinnamon, etc.

Save yourself the headache and just order the Bonide Systemic. Sprinkle a little on the soil of each plant and water it to activate. You might have to re-treat in a few months if they come back.

Edit: I also automatically assume that every new plant I buy has fungus gnats. As soon as I bring it home, I treat it with the Bonide systemic and water it. I also mix it into the top inch of soil when repotting plants."

You can make black tea and soak it in black tea all day and remove it from the tea at night.
Do it for a few weeks, until the leaves are harder and sturdier.
After that you can repot it and water it once a week. 
But it should be in a humid environment.

Watering on a schedule to begin with is a big plant care faux pas.  You only want to water a plant when it needs water, after 3 weeks it may not be sufficiently dry enough, say in winter when there's less daylight and plants slow down photosynthesis, thus using less water.  I water my sansevieria about once a month, I check them at the beginning of every month and see if they are dry enough (they must be completely dry) and for those that are not I will check again in a few weeks.  For the ones that can use a drink, I soak them in a container to fully saturate the soil, if the soil is dry then water would probably just run straight out and not soak in, so bottom watering in a container is the best bet.

 As for now, you can put it anywhere with indirect light and just admire it for at least a few weeks before you even think about watering it.  You can let it go without water for possibly up to a 3 months honestly, they want to be kept on the dry side."

294911,t3_sfils1,"i bought this lucky bamboo a few days ago, and repotted it from the horrors walmart had condemned it to, but now it’s turning yellow???","Hi! I posted months ago about my lucky bamboo and have learned a great deal of it. Hopefully I can help you with yours. The wrinkle lines that you see on the stalks it basically means that it is thirsty. Might be due to lack of water or damage to the root system. I’m seeing it at the top and in one of the small green stalks from the first picture. 

The yellow ones are gone. You can throw them away. They won’t go back to green or survive. Do you mind posting a picture of the roots? That could be the issue here. The roots system
Might be damage. Orange roots means old roots but healthy. White roots means new growth and healthy as well, now black ones and smelly because usually they are smelly that means bacteria and rot. You will have to remove this with clean scissors. A picture of this can help me to have an idea of what’s going on if you can.  Regardless I’m sharing my pointers to save these. :)

For the green ones there is a big possibility to save them if you are up for it and if the roots are damaged. Lucky bamboos seems easy to recover and save since they are pretty resilient. I have had mine for over three years now with a bad phase where I lost two stalks but I was able to saved the rest.

The commitment part comes. Take the green ones which would be 4 of them and put them separately in a small glass or container. Like a small mason jar, glass of water or anything small vase like where you can place it standing up with water. 

Add the water but use distilled water only. Depending on where you live the tap water can be very toxic to the bamboo. That’s how I almost killed mine sadly. Only use distilled water to be safe while it recovers but as far as I know all the sites of lucky bamboo advices to use distilled water or rain water if kept in water instead of soil. Now once these 4 stalks are in a separate container add the water until it covers less than half of the stalk. Making sure that it never goes below. This part it’s going to be annoying but try to keep it up as much as you can, change the water every 4 days or so. It’s basically to keep the water clean. Since these guys are small it’s pretty easy. And trust me they are re very resilient.

Never place them in direct Sun even if it is through a window. Needs to be indirect and bright light. Once in the container, eventually they will start getting white dots or pocking looking spots at the bottom.
Does are the roots developing and it’s good. Once it has a few and big enough, it’s time to place them together at the pot to look beautiful again. It takes a while but eventually they will go back to looking great. Important though you need to make sure the pot never goes dry since you are placing them in water. It always need to be covering with water or at least the base of the roots.

Hopefully this helps and I will be linking my posts so you have an idea. Any questions let me know and these are great/easy plants don’t worry. You got this! If you can share the picture of the roots though, please do it so I can have a better idea. Maybe you don’t even need to do the quarantine process I just have you. But you do need to remove the yellow stalks and use distilled water. Also I’m sorry for the wall lol. Just wanted to make sure to cover everything I can to help out. 
 
One more thing sorry forgot to add, tap water after 24 hours of sitting down its perfect as well but in the process for now I would just use distilled water. Once they are healthy go for the leaving the tap water to rest for 24 hours method like you were doing before.

Any help?,How often are you watering? They like to dry out and almost be ignored. It looks like it’s getting too much water and rotting. I’d cut off the brown stalks and probably repot too. It looks tiny
342277,t3_w9bgbw,a month difference thanks to your help I have been able to save this plant. Can I do something about the drooping leaves?,It's an Agave americana Marginata and those arching/bending leaves just seem to be part of its natural growth habit. Looking much better by the way!

Or even any general advice for it?,First I would repot it into well draining potting soil. It’s probably on clearance because it was overwatered so I would change the soil and check for mushy roots ASAP :)

279761,t3_r3jwy5,HORRIBLE root gnat infestation. The problem happened after I transplanted them. I think the soil may have had larvae in it :/. I used mosquito bits to try and get rid of them and haven’t watered in two weeks.

I used sticky traps, mosquito dunks, and neem oil soap but i had like 30 plants so they would always find another spot to go even though i was using those on everything. I caved in and got bonide granules and just sprinkled on all the soil and i noticed a difference within a week. I kept all the sticky traps up to help. I think the granules stopped the flies from reproducing in the soil. I would check that out if other methods seem to not be working."
44346,t3_eqx818,"Congo Verde is happy and healthy, but as it grows its lean gets more and more dramatic. Should I let it do it’s thing, or does it need supports to keep it a little more vertical?",Rotate it. Your plant is trying to grow towards the sunlight.

What should I do?,"I'm in Europe, I recognise the soil it's in, most likely 100% peat, which can be very hard to dry at the moment.

Get a bag of orchids soil (with bark), add some perlite, repot your plant, remove the rotten roots, and be mindful with watering! It'll get back to its former glory soon enough ;)"

Moisten it and put some in a wide bowl or jar.  Sprinkle spore on top.  Mist and cover the top each day.  I did this a while back and it took two months to get little tiny fronds.

I have since just collected leaves with spores, blitzed with water and moss in a blender, and splashed around shady spots in the garden.  Less reliable and less control, but I like the variety of what pops up."

Just treat it as anyother succulent, I have mine outside in partial/full sun at home and in a nice sunny south facing window at work. 

Definitely look up the specific light requirements if you're really concerned but I think you can just play around and see what happens. They're bery resilient plants."

I have it in a small south facing window too, it definitely gets more than enough light as it’s all pink from being sun stressed. 

I also saw a girl who did an experiment with one and the strands were very small and pink when it was getting lots of high light (south facing) vs bigger and greener when in a lower but sufficient light situation (bright indirect or west). I know it’s not the same plant but maybe there’s some correlation?"

322908,t3_us1un2,Leaf tips started browning after pruning only 2 leaves. Wasn’t any main stems or anything. Did I just kill this Monstera?,Your plant may be reacclimatizing to the pruning depending on the local climate. I’d keep an eye on that new leaf and make sure it continues coming in strong

The best way to deal with fungus gnats are mosquito dunks. Put one in a gallon of water, water plants. Gnats gone.

You can damage plants roots with hydrogen peroxide.

Mosquito dunks for all larvae in soil"

Not sure if we killed it during the move or if the high temps did?","Aw man. Sorry about your plant. It was most likely the high temps that did it. But the stems look to be in salvageable shape- I bet you can cut the dead leaves off, and propagate it and bring it back! They’re pretty resilient, and if you stick a stem with no leaves in water, it will rush to put new roots and a new leaf out. You should be good in a few weeks!!"

The nursery tag (clearly very specific) doesn’t say anything beyond generic fern care, had one of these gorgeous ferns when I was starting out with plants, killed it, trying again and want to give it the best chance of survival. Maybe called a lace fern?",Not sure but you can also try /r/whatsthisplant . Really though most fern care is pretty similar- you probably killed it by letting it dry out or possibly you burned it with too much direct sun. Not great houseplants for beginners or the forgetful- fail to water them for  long and it's all over! I'm in the latter category so I only can grow ferns outside in the ground in the shade- inside it's all succulents and other drought tolerant plants. :)

It’s a thin layer, and if disturbed reveals a slightly different color underneath.

201552,t3_mqdils,"Jade plant has been slowly but surely growing taller and sprouting new leaves, but the bottom leaves are consistently falling off 2+ a week every week. Is this normal?","It’s likely losing leaves because it can’t sustain both pushing out energy to make new growth and keeping all those leaves. You’re likely lacking light, or maybe nutrients. But, it’s also normal for jades to lose leaves as they grow taller so I wouldn’t fret too much- depending on how they’re trimmed, very old jades can look like mini trees with thick branches and no leaves on most of the branch at all! They’re also easy to overwater, so definitely make sure you’re letting them dry out a bit between waterings."

Can anyone help me save my work buddy?","I have one of these. They like indirect light and to be in a humid environment - you can substitute this by misting the leaves lightly every few days. Do not pour water into the center area where the fronds develop because this can cause rot. However, like others have mentioned the plant may benefit from getting watered from the top area alongside the plant to keep the soil more moist like their native tropical habitat.

I dont see anything about them being invasive beyond they eat invasive oleander(dont take my word for that though), so theres no problem removing them and letting them live somewhere else. 

Moths and butterflies are on the decline so as long as its not invasive its better for the environment to let them live/do their thing pollinating your flowers. I understand not wanting caterpillars eating your plants ofc, just meaning remove before spraying a preventitive. I dont like using pesticides as theyre doing a lot of damage to the earth, but ive heard spraying diluted alcohol can help prevent butterflies and moths laying eggs and helps prevent aphids.

I had to move my tradescantia from a mega sunny window to a less sunny wall shelf, and she's less purple with slightly more sparse growth now. Still going strong but I can tell the window was the optimal spot. Unfortunately I had to move it due to getting too big for the space."
346847,t3_wmnikt,What are these brown scales on my eternity plant and how can I remove them (I clean them and they grow back)?,that looks like scale to me. Quarantine that plant asap. You will have to remove each bug with alcohol on a q-tip and spray with an insecticide like neem oil. Keep a close eye on it and your other plants in case it comes back/spreads!

It looks in pretty good shape.  It doesn't need ""saving"", just consistent good care.  The brightest indirect sunlight you can give it, up to some direct sun.  Moderate moisture, never staying soggy, getting almost dry before watering again.  A little fertilizer once in a while.  It will grow well, but getting it to bloom again  can be challenge.  It should be easy to find detailed instructions."

Many people (me included) keep their ZZ plants in darker spots where other plants would die, because ZZ’s can manage that. But they will not thrive like your’s is! Seems like you have your Zamioculcas in a perfect spot. The new leaves will turn dark green with time. 

As far as repotting goes, they like to be root bound, which helps you not to overwater them, and supposedly helps them to grow upright. Keep doing what you are doing, making sure you don’t overwater it!"

If the rest of the plant looks healthy and is growing normally, then these should continue to grow as well.

Pothos is hearty, so as long as those white leaves dont become the dominant color over time I think its fine to leave them."

Not an expert on this plant but I have one and treat it like every other succulent- as in let it dry between waterings- and it hasn't died yet. It's normal for succulent leaves to shrink in dry conditions- that's why they're thick in the first place- to store extra water. Mold/overwater in succulents however is bad bad bad and makes them dead dead dead. Apparently peperomia likes a bit more moisture than most but I'd still err on the side of too little water.

Care instructions here:
https://plantcaretoday.com/peperomia-ferreyrae.html

Edited to add: I do think overwatering is causing your leaf loss but overall it still looks pretty healthy so I wouldn't worry too much. But cutting back on the actual watering and putting a pebble tray filled with water underneath to increase the humidity without making the plant's actual soil wet, as suggested in this article, is a good idea.

Edit 2: I forgot to mention- you have an inner and outer pot here- if the outer pot does not have a drainage hole make sure you dump out any standing water between the pots after you water or your soil will stay too wet too long. Succulents hate wet feet!"

What do I need to do?,"You should have no problem getting it to root by planting it in a well-draining mix and keeping it moist. It'll likely lose most of its leaves, but if it roots, it'll put out new ones with no problem.

You could also wrap the entire tuber in sphagnum and put it in a clear bag. But that could get a little expensive."

And are generally quite forgiving. If you want it to fill out more, you can pinch off the full ends and just stick the stems back in the dirt. They’ll root in no time. Remove any extra little leaves so you can get a good inch or two in the soil.

265205,t3_py70kp,Help! Is this soil spoiled? The bag was open months ago but sealed until now. What could this be growing over the surface?,"The bag says myco-active. Mycelium is fungus, and there's a beneficial relationship between plants and naturally occurring fungus. I personally would mix it up and maybe move it somewhere that moisture doesn't collect, because it looks like the mycelium is taking over the soil and that usually happens when there's an influx of water. Fungus usually likes pretty moist conditions in order to grow on the surface like this. I googled and the brand looks like PRO-MIX Mycoactive, but the website didn't specify what kind of mycelium they include in their mix but I would assume it's nothing that's going to damage a plant."

Make sure the soil is replaced and the pot is cleaned or preferably a different one. I would also suggest trying to give it a bit more light than usual (unless it’s already getting a lot of light) just so it gets the extra energy to rebuild the root system.

Is it just reaching for the light?,"If it's drooping and you stick your finger at least half way through the soil and it is soaking wet  then it's over watering, if it's drooping and your soil is dry it needs more water.

*DO NOT TRY TO UNRAVEL THE ROOTS*

These roots are bound, but healthy. Healthy roots will figure out they have more room to move around and will find their way. You messing with the root system will only cause unnecessary stress and damage.

Edit to add for haters: I’m not saying the plant will die if you unravel the roots. BTW cutting the bottom part off vs trying to unravel roots are totally different. I cut the roots on a lot of my plants. I’m saying that manhandling the roots will cause initial shock to an already stressed plant. 

*Don’t overthink plants… they thrive without human intervention &amp; will continue to do so. Just let the roots figure it out on their own.*"

I just reported into this blue pot with a drain and it was previously in its original pot with out a drain, could this be why?","Hi! Your plant is fine! Continue to water as usual, and keep it in the good sun of your window!

The leaves are likely browning due to mineral build up in the soil. You mentioned it previously lived in a pot with no drainage. Changing the soil will help this!

318549,t3_ugnzxa,I had to cut my rubber plant and make it grow new roots but now there’s this… thing ? Is it unhealthy for the roots ?,"It’s algae. Generally unhealthy, but it’s not a death-sentence in this photo. You still have healthy new root growth coming in. The algae will very gradually die off when you bury it in soil and the roots that are still young should help the older smothered roots recooperate. Potting up should be done fairly soon so that it doesn’t progress into choking out all the new roots too. Algae needs constant moisture and sunlight to survive, so once you get the roots established in soil, give it at least one dry spell (or at least the upper-most soil has dried) to ensure that the algae isn’t trying to make a come-back. In the future, change water weekly at minimum and use paper or something to block out light from your water in a prop container so algae doesn’t take hold."

To encourage branching, you need to prune the top of the tree. Cut off the top where u want it to start branching. Wait a few weeks and you should see at least 1-2 new branches pop out somewhere.

What now?,"First off, I just want to say your monstera is gorgeous. You should definitely take a few photos to appreciate later before you do anything.

So on to the advice, your variety of monstera is more like the vine type so you don’t need to worry about the pot size and instead worry about supporting the body of the plant with a taller moss pole than the one you have. If you go that route you’ll probably need to support the pole itself with anchors of the wall or ceiling.

If you want to give her a lovely pruning go right ahead and make sure you’re cutting at a node. Propagate those babies for more separate plants or to give them away to friends, family, strangers on the internet.

If you have no idea where to start for pruning check out [Planterina Monstera Pruning](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lO-GZOxEqiY)

Hope that gives you a good idea of where you start, would love to see what you end up doing."

151254,t3_k258t8,"I’ve seen bb toes split vertically from overwatering, but does anyone know why mine are horizontally amputating themselves?","Best tip I’ve heard, only water a succulent when the leaves go soft (if they aren’t soft it means their water reserves are full and things like this will happen). Also, never use pre-mix soil alone. Even if you have purchased succulent specific soil, you should still cut it with 50% perlite. Nearly all store bought soil mixes are too dense and retain too much water for succulents."

What could it be?,"That’s the newest leaf, how long has it been open? Sometimes this happens to my new leaves temporarily and I’ve never worried about it. I guess I just assumed it’s a reaction to no longer having the force of being curled in the opposite direction as it unfolds. As the leaf gains rigidity it has always straightened back up."

You can try removing it with alcohol on cotton. But it is a very bad infestation so if you are not very attached to it, I would recommend tossing it out."
303801,t3_t77zxy,Any idea what these white root things are sprouting from my epiphyllum anguliger? They weren’t there when I bought the plant. Can they be prevented?,"Aerial roots.  They are completely normal in a naturally epiphytic plant that must constantly search for support, light, nutrients and moisture to survive in its tree-top environment.  They can't be prevented, but if the plant truly gets everything it needs from the roots in the pot and its place in the light then they may be minimized.  If you don't like the natural appearance it won't harm the plant much if you cut them short."
316088,t3_ua5rsu,I repotted my monstera a week ago and now these 3 leaves have turned/begun to turn yellow. Is this normal? If so will I lose these leaves or will they bounce back?,"Unfortunately, once a leaf goes that yellow there’s really no turning back. Here’s the abridged science version: plant gets stressed, plant decides to reallocate resources to survive, and it typically picks lower leaves like that to sacrifice. BUT then even if it starts to get better and hypothetically could want to revive the leaf, there now isn’t enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize."

I had the best basil inside on my windowsill once, and I had a lot of fungus gnats (didn't know what they were or where they were coming from at the time- was not fun) but I never had aphids. Are they from another plant?"
256245,t3_pgdujc,"My one leaf, one node cutting is only putting out white leaves through the node. What can I do about it?","The white leaves still have some green on their petiole and therefore the vine. Hopefully you get some green back soon. Buying a half white single node cutting had a pretty high chance to start going full white. Research would have yielded this information. Fortunately again, in your case I see some green still present on the petiole of the fully white leaves. Meaning they could put a leaf out with a good amount of green still just your chances are getting slimmer the less green you have. And even if you don’t see green or see variegation on green doesn’t mean it won’t pop back up later. Just less chance with less. Good luck and hope you get some working tissue in the next few leaves. It’s always best to buy a multiple node cutting for this reason. Professional growers when they see a half moon leaf pop up usually chop and prop then. Just to start activating other nodes for this very reason. Half moons pretty but often lead to fully variegated are overly variegated."
8526,t3_bemrl9,"Just bought a new home, came with a Japanese maple. Zone 8. Should I be worried about the top portion? It seems dead and I want to encourage upward growth. Any tips or otherwise?","This is a waterfall maple, so you’re never going to get upward growth, per se.  
They’re fussy things and I’d wait to see how it leafs out.  It’s a maple and so better to prune this midsummer anyway. 
Watch for where the bark is collaring around deadwood and do t cut into any collars."

285023,t3_rlagpv,"I repotted my house plants, suddenly I have a million of these little flies. Any idea what they are and how to get rid?", Bottom water with mosquito bit tea to kill any larvae living deeper in the pot. This should leave the first two to three inches of the soil dry. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth on the dry top soil. You can also sprinkle it in the water catcher so that gnats will die if they try and go in through the drainage holes. Adult gnats that crawl through or land on diatomaceous earth will die (just make sure whatever surface you are applying the diatomaceous earth to is dry). You could also cover the drainage holes with nylons so that the gnats can't get back in that way. Use yellow sticky traps to catch even more adults. I have been doing this regimen for a while now and it seems to have worked very well.

As long as it’s warm outside where you are, and you don’t put it in direct sun right away, this tropical plant will do just fine outdoors. I have one that’s permanently outdoors (front porch) and one that moves outside (back patio, covered) each summer. This is a tropical plant, not a pine tree like the name suggests. It likes lots and lots of sunshine, well-draining soil, and regular watering (I don’t let mine dry out more than 50%). You can cut off the dead/brown bits at the ends of the fronds for a cleaner look. This is truly a beautiful, specimen plant you have here. Also, I’ve found that mine like to be somewhat snug in their pots, so I wouldn’t repot yours just yet. Again, congrats on the new plant; it’s stunning!"
304430,t3_t8wbrc,"My mom cutted down all leaves of 4 of my plants (she’s a narcissist, don’t even ask) saying “they were dying”. How can I revive them?","I'm sorry she did that. Yes, they can come back from that if they were generally healthy before. The ficus may be slower, but all the others are plants the grow from rhizomes in the soil and are particularly good at growing back from being bare. Keep the soils slightly moist (at a similar level to when it had leaves, but remember it may take longer to dry without the leaves to transpire the water). When you get to your new place put them in bright, indirect light and have patience. Hopefully they will greet you again."

13676,t3_bvl79g,I got this little bonsai (I believe Juniper) as a gift. It's been around now for about 6 months but has recently started to dry and brown. Any help I can give this little guy?,"Was it kept indoors? Unfortunately, Juniper can't be kept indoors long term. This is a common issue, as many unscrupulous sellers don't make that clear when selling juniper bonsai. 

Juniper are also the subject of a common scam, because they stay green for a very long time, even when they're just a cut branch. Many big box stores and mall outlets sell 'bonsai' that are little more than cut branches in pots. They stay green for a very long time, but are not  alive... and as juniper doesn't propegate from cut branches, no matter how well you take care of it, it'll eventually die. 

Whether it had roots to begin with or not, it's dead now. If you decide to try again in the future, /r/bonsai is a great resource. It's a good idea to read up on the type of tree you're planning on keeping before you bring it home."

It’s possible that this was an issue before you even brought it home as it is common for nurseries to water plants from above. You will need to remove that leaf to keep it from spreading.

I would also peel down and remove all the smaller onion-like skins on the lower portion. You want the end to be as clean as possible, before potting.

If you have a rooting hormone, use **liberally** \- not just a ""dusting"". Soak the newly planted cutting, then leave it in a location with moderate light and watch the moisture level in the soil. Don't let the soil get soggy or sit in water, but don't let it dry out completely either."

Does your plant have adequate drainage? Can it breathe in a good terra cotta pot?

You may need to do some plant surgery. Get disinfected cutters. Cut off all affected leaves and then unpot the sucker. Check out the roots and look for any slimy, black, limp roots that have a smell. Those are rotted, and you’ll have to carefully cut them out. Cut out any roots that have mold or other fungsy things growing on them. Our monstera had gray fuzzies on some roots. Carefully take them out without touching other parts of the plant as much as you can. 

After this, spray your plant with some neem oil. Douse those leaves. Apparently sprinkling cinnamon on the soil helps with bacterial infections, but as I’ve only heard that for keeping away bugs, I can’t back it up. However I sprinkled that bitch anyway. If nothing, your plant will smell like fall."

Please could someone help explain why this has happened and what to do to avoid it happening?,"So terra cotta 'breathes', i.e. allows for moisture in the soil to evaporate through the porous pot.

The darker spots look like mold. This can happen if the pot is too wet for too long.

I decided finally to repot it with a succulent potting mix. I think on taking it out of the pot - even though I bought it somewhere reputable -  it was in regular soil and it was not draining properly when being watered.  I did cut some roots off that looked worse for wear and potted some as cuttings which felt awful but I think it had to be done.  That was a few weeks back and I have been spare with the water and kept it in a sunny spot.

Maybe a bit too early to tell, but the pearls have lost some of the swollen look and the cuttings are rooting. I was so depressed because I feel I could have spotted it earlier, but yours looks in better shape."
316551,t3_ub9lgy,"I was *repotting* my pothos when my cat chewed off a 5ft vine. I’ve had great success water propagating this plant before. Can I just “propagate” one end of the vine and replant it? Do super long propagations work? 2nd, can I propagate/pinch the rest of the plant now or will that be too much stress?","Note: this is a philodendron brazil, not actually a pothos! The care is basically the same, but they're a little pickier with cuttings. It'll hurt cats if they gnaw it, but *usually* doesn't cause harm unless they're actually eating it.

Also, are those white streaks on some of the leaves? Because if so, I am insanely jealous."
316509,t3_ub5lsi,"My husband got this for me from Home Depot- can it and if yes, when can it be planted outside? Will it grow back perennially?","That really depends on where you live.

10593,t3_bmd2s0,I pulled my dead calathea out &amp; noticed it has this dense growth off the roots. Is it by chance some type of baby plant energy ball that the plant decided to put its soul into for me to repot and then it’ll regrow like a phoenix? Or did it die of natural causes and I just can’t have fancy plants?,Calatheas have tubers. Keep it planted and under a humidity dome. The phoenix will rise again.

Generally they like a lot of sun, and like to be completely soaked around every 6-10 days with dry spells in between.

There were little creepy crawlers crawling around in the webs and the white dots all through the soil. Stripped all the soil out and put the clean roots in fresh water. What is it?",That's Leucocoprinus birnbaumii fungus. Really common in tropical house plants actually. Especially if the soil mix has tree bark chunks in it. Spores love to stick to that stuff. They are actually a good sign. They help break down the organic components of the soil and help feed your plants. Fungi and plants kind of talk to eachother and they help eachother thrive. Don't be surprised if they come back after some time as its really hard to get rid of them completely but it's ok they won't hurt your plant. When the mushrooms grow out of the soil please remove them carefully and wash your hands after because they are considered poisonous to humans and most animals...not the it'll kill you kind just extremely unpleasant

I had a ficus tree that would drop all it's leaves anytime it's light source changed, then it would decide it wasn't a death sentence and it would put out new leaves.

Typically, you can grow a plant in water with a clear planter since it’s fully submerged in water and does not have soil, which could potentially have root rot fungus.  On the other hand, you can grow a plant in soil in an opaque planter, with proper watering, as the roots aren’t exposed."
248636,t3_p29iuv,"Just had a panicked called from my sister as this guy has “fishy smelling foam” coming out of him, does anyone know what this is?","My uneducated guess would be stem rot or soft rot which can be caused by bacteria or fungi entering from the soil into the roots and traveling up the stem of the dracaena. 

Over-watering / improper drainage / lack of oxygen can result in the fungi multiplying and using the plant as its host. I am afraid this could be it for your sister's plant. I am sorry. 

Sadly there are not enough photos to have a better look at the overall plant and perhaps a few closeups of the stem. 

Perhaps try to sterilizing the pot, replace the soil and maybe cut the stem up to see if it can be salvaged but I highly doubt it. A bad smell is usually a sign that its over."

I'd recommend that you repot this in a much bigger pot - birds of paradise and the like get very strong root systems that can quite literally break through and make it very difficult to untangle.

Given that the leaves are green still, I would assume that it's generally healthy. Checking the leaves (including their undersides) for bugs is always a good idea, especially if you're going to put this near your other plants.

EDIT: Upon second look, my heart is breaking. There is a furled new leaf that has been bent over. I think the plant is healthy; it just needs a place with no height restrictions and some TLC"

I am regularly frustrated by English ivies. Especially because they only seem to have one symptom: Crispy. Overwatered? Crispy. Underwatered? Crispy. Too much light? Crispy. Too little light? Crispy. Aaaaahhhh!

FWIW (I have killed quite a few), I would check:

1) For pests. Everything loves to eat them.

2) Watering. Ivies like to be kept on the moister side. But not soggy, never, never soggy.

3) Sunlight. Perfect lighting for this guy is outdoors in England. So more light than a lot of indoor spaces. But remember England is a very cloudy, rainy place. Never direct sun, and never ever anywhere too hot.

English Ivy is . . . so much harder than people assume. I like to think of the ideal environment as ""Outdoors England"" so . . . plenty of moisture and humidity, never soggy, with lots of bright but filtered light (think cloudy), never hot or direct sun."

I would pull it out of that pot, separate any smaller plants that have grown off of the base, and cut away any dead roots.

53910,t3_fisedc,"My snake plant has one leaf that's much taller than the rest, but it's super thin toward the base. Do I cut it? And what to do about the crispy edges on the leftmost leaf?","So,to begin with while Sanseverias tolerate lower light levels, optimally  they require more light than most people tend to think when they hear the word low light. Low light in an outdoor environment is not the same as low light in an indoor environment. That said, I believe that you should gradually acclimate your plant to higher levels of light and only cut off any part of its leaves that show significant damage... if the damage is minimal then wait for the leaf or leaves to dry out on their own before cutting them off... with the increase in light levels you should after a period notice more vibrant healthier color and structure to your plants leaves and overall shape. Also make sure to water only when it has dried out without leaving it dry longer than 3 to 7 days depending on how pot bound the plant is. I hope this helps my friend, Hikari 🌸🙏🌸"

167776,t3_kzqdg6,There is a complete brown leaf evolving from my Raphidophora Tetrasperma. Should I cut it already? What‘s happening?,"And in complete contrast with another commentor, I'm going to say your plant has dried out, not been too wet. 

This often happens to me when I let a plant go too long without a drink. The new growth is the last to get that drink so it's the first to go. 

If this was a problem with overwatering, your leaves would be yellow or brown/black spots, this is crispy which signifies drought. 

The only time crispyness occurs on a root rotted plant is when it's been rotted for so long it's not able to get a drink anymore. 

Hope this helps! 

Also, yes, cut it off. It's dead."
337860,t3_vx6wb1,any idea what plant this is? workmate grows them off cuttings easily and they survive in office water cups easily so grabbed some for the home and desk.... curious what it's called? care tips?,"Definitely devils backbone also called the zig zag plant. They are very cool looking. 

They can take direct sun on its leaves indoors, and with enough light, you get to enjoy pink or bronze tones to the foliage. Devil's backbone is a fun houseplant for a medium to bright spot. It can tolerate low light for extended periods, but eventually leans toward the light and gets lanky, becoming unattractive (don't recommend it for low light). 

Pruning devil's backbone isn't necessary, nor is fertilizing. But you can fertilize it a couple of times per year if you want it to grow faster. In this case, use a houseplant fertilizer and following the directions on the product's label. 

But they are toxic to pets and humans. If you do decide on keeping it, do a quick google search on care.  It’s one of the easier houseplants to keep, It can survive extended periods without water, but it tends to drop its lower leaves if it goes without water too long. 

Avoid touching the plant's milky sap, as it may lead to skin irritation; however, you can touch the green leaves without fear of toxicity."

You're plant looks fine follow the others advice, but if you have access to outdoors during the summer when temps are above 80f water more often and fertilize at double the rate.  They explode with growth with this when it's hot.  Use a well drained soil and never over pot it.  Keep the pot just bigger than the bulb size.  We water every other day during the summer months as the water gets used up just about everyday.  Once fall sets in they go to every week or so with little to fertilizer."

 These guys are dramatic as hell, so it'll probably perk up a lot once it starts getting good care.

182864,t3_ls5nv0,Can you help me with conflicting advice? Is it better to let yellow leaves completely die off to the point where they can easily be plucked off so that the plant can “absorb nutrients from the leaf” or should they be trimmed sooner as to prevent wasted energy going towards the dying leaf?,"I’m going to be the voice of dissent here, at the risk of being massively downvoted.  The idea that dying leaves cost the plant energy is common houseplant dogma and can be found in conversations on every houseplant forum.  I have yet to see any evidence to support this statement, but am happy to be proven wrong.

When leaves die from natural causes (senescence) the process is catabolic.  What that means is that large molecules within the dying leaves are broken down to mobilize nutrients and energy which are then redistributed to other parts of the plant.  [Here is an article detailing that process.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4429656/)  The overall result is net positive with regards to energy (carbohydrates) and nutrients and there’s a reason plants hold on to dying leaves for so long.

This only applies to senescent leaves.  Leaves that die for other reasons should be removed.  

That being said, we grow houseplants because we like how they look and droopy yellow leaves detract from that."

Any advice please?","Unfortunately these coconut trees I’ve been seeing in box stores sold as houseplants are a short-term novelty. 

Coconut palms need a lot of very bright light—direct sun for most of the day—and very high humidity. 

Most homes simply cannot provide those conditions. It would be uncomfortably muggy to keep your home above 70% humidity all the time and your drywall and boards would get moldy. A humidifier might keep the humidity up around 40% or maybe 50%, but coconut palms need much more. 

Additionally, even a bright south-facing window may not be enough light; they really need intense overhead light. 

Coconuts are remarkably tough and well-adapted plant within a specific range of conditions—they are extremely tolerant of salt, and can use ocean water to grow, so they’re at home on balmy island beaches. That ability is really rare in the plant world (sodium is toxic to most plants). 

Additionally, their seeds float on ocean currents so they are set up to colonize and thrive on remote volcanic islands in the tropics. 

And they are very good at staying upright in hurricanes! They can even tip over if the sand/soil washes out and keep growing as long as some roots are in the ground. 

But the home is not within their skill set. 

As sold, they will last about as long as it takes for the plant to use up the energy stores from the coconut, then they will decline."

If it's spider mites, just spray the area with a solution of 2 teaspoons of dish soap per quart of water then sprinkle diatomaceous earth. You'll need to do it after every watering, but it should kill off the insects. Also it should be safe to use in tea if it's mite related.

Her petals pop off SO easily I can barely move the pot around to find a good spot that my cats cant get to. I've had her for 4 days and shes very dusty, too. Advice to keep her thriving?","If it has been grown without too much light, do not just throw it into any direct sun for more than short bursts at a time, else it may burn.  After you know how much light it can tolerate, gradually increase until you are giving it as much light as you possibly can. Next, water it with a dilute mix of houseplant fertilizer (use no more than 1/4 of the recommended strength) every time you do water it, and do water it more than once a month, especially once it is getting high light conditions.  As far as repotting, if you begin fertilizing, and it is getting good light, it should start to perk up (hold the leaves more upright and not drop them easily) and it should show signs of new growth at the tips.  Once you see new growth, then repot. Do not go up in size too fast, but do consider a large enough pot to accommodate a large rock on the bottom, as Jade Plants can get rather top heavy especially in lighter soils."

Peace lilies appreciate good light and occasional green blooms are pretty common, but if you start to see lots of them, you might consider finding a less bright spot in your home for it.

This being said, it's not the end of the world. If the plants healthy it'll be fine, it's okay to lose a couple leaves. And it's normal when changing environments."

Flowering uses a lot of the plant’s energy, so a lot of people will cut the stalk off so the plant can focus on growing leaves. (Personally, I am a sucker for blooms, so I usually leave them.)

Regardless, I agree it needs more light! The plant is leaning because it is searching for sun. Move it closer to a window that gets good light if you can. You may want to do it gradually to prevent the leaves getting sunburned."

Not only is that perfectly normal for a heart leaf philodendron but it's actually a good sign that the plant is happy and healthy. The size of the leaves could be due to the decreased light it's getting now that it's winter time but by the time they mature they'll only be marginally smaller than the others. 

I noticed that you mentioned watering your philo from the bottom (or ""butt chugging""). That will certainly help build a stronger root structure after a recent repotting but make sure you give it a water from the top every few weeks. This will help wash out built up salts that can hamper growth in larger quantities. 

Hope this helps — Let me know if you have any other questions! 

Love,

43293,t3_en7vlp,Worried about the yellowing leaves. Ive had this plant for 2 days and noticed the yellowing leaves yesterday. Seems like the other leaves are starting to yellow as well. Help! What should i do?,"Cool Alocasia. This is a tough one since you recieved they plant so recently its hard to know what's happening without knowing previous care.

In spite of the marginal chlorosis I would lean away from fertilizer requirements as plants normally have slow release fertilizer in the growing media so they they don't starve as soon as they are delivered.

They can go sort of 'dormant' in winter and require less waterings however I don't know if this would have been held in warmer temperatures preventing dormancy before it was delivered. 

I feel like it could be temperature /humidity stress after the recent move causing it to display this symptoms or perhaps it got a heavy watering before you recieved it and the media was overly saturated. They're very perticular about their soul moisture so too wet or too dry are both detrimental. But knowing the state the plant is an important factor in determining soil moisture. (is it somewhat dormant or is it still actively growing/drinking?) 

Check your RH levels and perhaps incorporate a pebble tray if it's on the low side which could help marginal burn, and give it a location that sees lots of light and hope it improves would be my best advice."

My best advice would be to find a good spot with light so it’ll grow more compact and eventually give you pups that you can divide off neatly.

1. Make sure the pot isn't too wet (you can let it dry out a bit in between waterings). If you soak it constantly, the roots will rot. That could take a while to recover from.
2. Make sure its getting enough light. Even though a lot of vining plants can tolerate lower light levels, you still want to make sure its by a window that gets a decent amount of light throughout the day. I have some swedish ivy that I have toward the edge of my grow lights and it does fantastic.
3. Make sure the temperature in your house is at least &gt;70 F at all times. If its by a window already, it could be a bit colder there. Just something to check up on.
4. If the first three things don't work out and you really want to see a lot of vining growth, look into getting some nutrient supplements.

But they do live off the fungus growing in the soil and since it thrives in moist conditions, it might mean you are overwatering your plants. 

Neem oil will not help since the eggs and larvae live in the soil (I assume your sprayed the plants with it).

Mosquito bits (if available in your country) or nematodes are common ways of getting rid of them. Also yellow sticky traps will help knock the population down.

I would be careful with putting the plants outside as some of them, in particular the peace lily, can get easily scorched in direct sun (I did that to mine this summer).

I wouldn't be afraid of the fungus gnats, but perhaps be weary of root rot, since they are often harbingers of this condition."

If the other trunks feel hollow and are kind of loose when you wiggle them, definitely pull them out gently. They should come right out with a little bit of force. If they don’t come out relatively easily, don’t force it. I’d also recommend repotting what you have and checking the roots for binding stuff like bands or sponge cores.

If the stems still feel dense and are securely in there, leave em for now. When they’re dead dead you’ll know (hollow and wiggly). Either way, if that has not been repotted get that bby into some new soil and check it’s roots while you’re there :)"

31891,t3_de5ut7,My aunt gave me this cactus last Christmas; she said it's 25 years old. It looked like this when I got it and has not grown or changed at all. I don't water it very often because I don't want to overwater it. Are the brown spots some kind of disease? How can I make it healthier and grow more?,"It's is scarring, probably from having been sunburned or gotten too cold, it's not harmful. Might be a very slow growing cactus. It will grow faster if it has more light and water, just make sure to introduce it slowly to a brighter situation so it doesn't sunburn again."

For root rot you can also buy enzymes that like to eat up dead roots and keep the roots all-around healthy.

And does anyone know what plant this is?,"That is a very, very, very sad Jade plant. How much water did you add? It's better to water these by sitting the pot in a water dish and letting them absorb it.

Are there holes at the bottom of the pot? Does the soil feel very dense? It may be your best bet to remove it from that pot, check the health of the roots, then re-pot it into a smaller pot, with well-draining soil. Adding some perlite to the soil mix would help with that. And make sure you use a pot with drainage holes. Then just a little TLC may save it. They are super resilient plants and can bounce back very well with the proper care. It's also worth giving it a close examination to make sure there isn't a bug infestation that's made it this sad."

120088,t3_ikka7w,"A bunch of my pothos leaves are getting these dried up brown spots on the edges, and some have some speckled brown spots. Am I overwatering or is it time to find a new pot/trim the roots?","I usually find that brown spots are due to sunburn, under watering, or root rot. 

I would pull it out of the pot and check the roots. If there are a lack of roots, or mushy spots, you need to trim the dead roots and repot in fresh dirt. Make sure to water less in the future. 

If the roots are fine, consider if it’s in full sun or a lot of light, it may need to move further away from the window. 

If you are letting it dry out between waterings, and light or rot isn’t the issue, you may try upping the watering. 

Finally, if the plant hasn’t been repotted in a couple years, it’s probably due for a repot into fresh soil. You should also be sure to be feeding it regularly with an appropriate fertilizer."

Should I change the soil?,"I got a monstera with a scale infection back in September and I did exactly what you did once a week and sprayed/wiped down the leaves, stems and pot with a neem/dish or Castile soap solution for a few months! The neem oil and soap acts as a preventative for young bugs to latch on, and it’s important to keep it up for a while after you think they’re gone to avoid a new batch of eggs hatching and starting a new infestation :)"

Browning tips usually come from root rot or bounded roots. Make sure you don’t water it too much, let it dry between waterings, it’s a Mediterranean plant, it doesn’t mind being dry and it DEFINITELY doesn’t like being in wet soil for long. If it’s currently cold where you live, I’d suggest you just stop watering until spring comes, unless the soil becomes bone dry. If it’s hot, then it’s fine for you to be watering it that often but only if you are making sure that the soil is completely dry before watering. You could move it to a slightly bigger pot with some new soil so that it has the nutrients to grow and the roots can breath better. Just make sure the pot isn’t too big and the soil is veeery well draining or else the roots could rot. 
Don’t worry too much though, it’s a sturdy plant, it’ll probably get better with new growth :)"
292937,t3_s9zfud,My grandfather recently passed and this was the only thing I got from his house. Can anyone help me identify and save this plant?,"I can't tell what kind of plant that is, but the stem looks healthy and the few leaves look like a succulent. It could be a very old kalanchoe, or a jade or a portulacaria afra or something else entirely. They are all hardy plants that easily bounce back. All of these plants grow in very arid environments in sandy gritty soil and intense sun. They want their soil to dry out completely and stay dry for a while between waterings, and then have their soil soaked thoroughly. The soil should dry in a few days, if it stays wet too long it will damage the roots. Fertilise lightly in the summer, unless it's a kalanchoe, then you fertilise when it flowers. 

If the soil is wet, let it dry out. If the soil is dty, water it. Put the pot somewhere where it gets a few hours of sun every day"

I would make sure it has good drainage hole to get rid of any access but other than that, it looks healthy!

103675,t3_hxn533,Plant does not seem to be improving after moving out of direct light and giving some nutrients - help?,"OP, I'm sorry that you were given such bad advice in that first post. Despite no watering changes, or maybe because of them, this is almost certainly an overwatering issue. For *M. adansonii*, the soil needs to dry *almost* completely between waterings, but not quite. If it goes fully dry, you almost always get a chlorotic leaf. By the way, it's smart that you've left them on the vine because they're currently in the process of photynthate reallocation, so you're allowing the plant to retrieve those sugars for later use. 

If you haven't, you really should check the roots to make sure that they are healthy. Look to see if the soil has been compacted. Since you've had it for a year, it may just be due for repotting. I find that they benefit from it and start to decline if it's been awhile since their pot situation was refreshed. While I wouldn't recommend  5+ hours of direct light, a few hours in the morning or late afternoon would be perfect since it's similar to what they get in their natural habitat."

Most of the branches are dried and brown. Is she savable?","Sorry about your grandmother. Might I suggest replacing some of the plants with realistic fakes?  Not to trick her, you should tell her, but just to take a chore off her plate while still having some green in the home. We did this with my grandma and she liked it.

16711,t3_c4gzl2,"My arrowhead(?) has gotten quite long and can no longer hold itself upright, should I be putting in stakes and tying it up to carry some weight?","Your arrowhead plant is probably not getting enough light. They are a vining plant, but tend to stay bushier if they get a good deal of light. Try moving it closer to a window and it should perk up a little.

You could stake it up if you want to, though."

Why are the leaves curling?,"Calatheas are so fussy so it's hard to pinpoint exactly what they're mad about today. They curl up naturally, so it's not a huge deal, but ty ppl ideally mine do it if they're underwater or if I give them tap water. They like filtered."
147339,t3_juoumt,Bought this Begonia Maculata already in bad shape. I've been trying to mend it back to health. Any tips? Should I prune back those 2 burn leaves?,"I just bought one too from Steve's Leaves! Its leaves are starting to crisp, so I immediately put it under a humidifier and its about 1 foot from a NE glass patio door. I assume at the nursery they are under bright grow lights and perfectly warm humid conditions, so maybe they are just going through shock adjusting to their new environment? It probably doesn't help that we are entering the dark winter season (in Northern Hemisphere) :(

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I would prune off the dying leaves, so the plant isn't expending extra energy trying to repair them."

Before I throw away the barely used bag, I cannot just throw out the moldy bits and use it for my houseplants, can I?","A good healthy soil will always have mold/fungus spores. It's the biodiversity that plants thrive in. Boiling/baking your soil will kill all of that, the its just dirt. Itll work, but it wont be as beneficial. Let it dry out in the sun (lay it out, not in the closed bag) and it will go away, at least visibily. The perfect moisture and conditions just let it run a little wild looks like. Get a plant in there and let the sybiosis take over and then you won't even notice :)"
284144,t3_ri36e7,My aloe plant felt very loose so to speak and when I gently checked every piece came out 😟 What happened? Can I save them somehow?,Looks like root rot.

They need more water than you think. Mine originally yellowed so I chopped and put directly in soil to propagate. I water them once a week and they’re thriving.
183998,t3_lu465a,Pothos no longer lush! I’ve been reading a lot and the soil seems to always be dry. I water it twice a week. I bought miracle gro fertilizer as some have suggested here but is there something else I should do? Change pots? Open up blind?,"Take it down, put it in the sink and fill the sink with water up to about an inch or so below the edge of the pot. Let soak for 30-40min or so. If air bubbles are still coming to the surface after 15-20 min, poke into the soil mass with a chopstick or wooden skewer to break up any dry spots. Drain the water and let the pot drain then hang back up. Sometimes potting soil can get so dry that it repels water. Soaking it really well will saturate the whole pot and hydrate those hydrophobic pockets. Since most people water hanging plants shallowly but frequently, instead of a deep watering infrequently, they are prone to those hydrophobic pockets."

I think it may be frost damage, but I'm afraid to bring it inside if it's something else that could spread to my other plants.

Let the soil get super dry in between waterings, even let the plant wilt a little bit and then give it a thorough watering. And repeat. The soil also needs to be well draining. 

I'm assuming the brown tips is from using tap water. Tap water usually has salts and the like that can build up in the soil and over time hurt the plant. You can use distilled water every once in a while to help leach some of those salts out of the soil though. 

Also a WEAK fertilizer probably wouldnt hurt, depending on how old that soil is."
175232,t3_ldyof5,Repotted and now not happy... Used houseplant compost which is still damp weeks later. Probably shouldn’t have done this in winter...

Are they salvageable if I put them in soil?","I'd water prop the syngonium. They root pretty nicely, so don't worry! From the tiny area of leaf I see, I'd say it's a syngonium 'pixie'? A quick google would confirm / deny that.

r/Syngonium is a great place to ask for any further advice you need, or r/propagation / r/proplifting for propagation tips. Funnily enough, aquarium water is great for water propagations due to the nutrients in it - you could possibly even keep the syngonium in your tank if it's an open-top one!

Edit: Just seen your 'white butterfly' identification, definitely could be that too. They're quite similar!"

Once they have routed you can cut the vine and you will have a new string!

Will it survive long enough to overcome this or is it something that needs attention ASAP?","You have to give it a super deep watering during or right after high winds because otherwise the leaves appear to ""burn"" - thy don't really but the tree gets dehydrated really easily when the roots aren't that deep, and the leaves get crunchy and die off.  If the tips do get crunchy, you need to trim them back to where the twig is still flexible and likely new leaves may bud from there."

Indeed harmless, and often beneficial. Folks add these to growing mediums and terrariums to manage decaying plant matter (which they eat) and to add nutrients to the soil (which they poop out). Having these in your soil is a good indicator of health and bioactivity, and will likely result in healthier plants overall."

I bought this fern as an indoor plant. When I’ve found the caterpillars I’ve gently removed them from the plant and tossed them outdoors. I live in Ohio and it’s quite nice out, so they’ll be able to do their thing out there.

The caterpillars didn’t stop appearing so I’ve hung the fern on the front porch. From the comments it sounds like the little critters will either grow up and pollinate to their hearts content or feed some local birds. I’ll bring the fern back inside once the weather starts to turn chilly and hope it’s clean by then.

64144,t3_g5lvcm,"I got Bianca (Castafiore) about 3 months ago. She started blooming immediately but I noticed she had 2 skightly lighter green leaves. I took it for variegation since she arrived that way, but now they're clearly dying off and have rust-coloured spots. What's wrong with Bianca?",I’ve been having the same issue with my Ludisia Orchid. It has been in bloom to which I know takes away some of the energy reserved for leaves but it stopped loosing as many leaves when I moved to a shadier location. The best advice someone gave me was to do research on their natural habitat. Ie. My orchid is low lying on the tropical floor so it’s usually shaded and receives dappled filtered light only. It usually has a canopy of shade from bigger trees. Just a tip someone shared with me. I hope this helps!

370856,t3_yw4bdu,Help! Can I save my monstera? I had to move houses in -20 weather the other day and I think it killed the leaves. Every single one is affected but the stems all seem healthy still. Is there anything I can do to try to salvage??,"I would leave the leaves, unless they brown out fully. There still may be some photosynthetic tissue and that can help the plant with energy for recovery and new growth (if the growth tip isn’t frozen—but even if it were, some dormant buds in the nodes may have survived). If the leaves turn yellow or brown they bear no further functions for the plant and can be cut off on the bottom, close to the stem."
217101,t3_niehww,I think the chili plant I bought 2 days ago has aphids. Can anyone confirm and how do I get rid of them?,"My favourite method if the plant and/or the aphid population isn‘t too big: Milk and a paintbrush. Dilute the milk 1:1 with water and use the paintbrush to collect and wash the aphids off. The good thing is that the milk will kill any small bug that gets wet with it, as it will clog their breathing tubes when drying. Can leave a drop of milk in any nook and cranny where you can‘t really get into with the brush, too. 

Will cause some white staining on the plant, but can be washed off later. On the plus side, it‘s eco-friendly and really cheap 🌿"
213423,t3_nbdcmt,HELP! I just got this abandoned aloe from a friend in order to save it. I really think the are multiple issues here. Is it really beyond saving? Pls help! What csn i do?,"It looks like it has a pretty gnarly mealybug infestation (the white fuzzy stuff). Wipe/swab with a qTip dipped in rubbing alcohol, making sure you get between the creases of the leaves in the middle of the plant. After the visible ones are gone, spray the plant with insecticidal soap or a blend of water + dish soap weekly for at least 2 months (their life cycle length).

You may have to do this a few times as they will keep coming back until you kill off enough of the population to disrupt their life cycle. 

Currently the aloe looks fine aside from that. They like as much light as you can give them, and appreciate a monthly deep soak of water - less often if it’s a very big aloe. If the soil is super wet I would consider repotting in a sandy soil, but in my experience most aloe are forgiving unless you’re drowning them."

That soil does look very damp. I fear I overwater every plant of mine that lives outside. It gets triple digits here every day though. :/ 

Try to let him dry out a bit (not too much depending how warm/dry the climate is where you are) before watering again? Maybe someone smarter than me will comment!

And the stem and new growth point shows obvious white Variegation. I'm in love and don't want it to revert! Anyone experience this with a Jade b4??,Wow I can only imagine seeing a variegated plant irl in my dreams lol. Anyway you should take cuttings of only the variegated part and propagate it. If you keep it on the plant it has a high chance of reverting. So cut the variegated part and put it in water and make it root! Variegation is pretty rare so you don't wanna lose it!

Be careful with those huge pots, they won't dry out when there are no roots to drink water. Ideally you'd put them in a shallower pot for awhile so there's not so much empty soil."

these mushrooms are not mycorrhizal, they're saprobes! this means that instead of linking roots with your plant and exchanging nutrients that way, the mushrooms actually work to decompose already dead organic matter in the soil. 

this will not harm your plant and may still be beneficial to it because the dead organic matter is being broken down into more accessible nutrients. coprinoids (ink caps) are common in yards and landscaped areas.

99920,t3_htortz,Took my money plant out of the nursery container and found this. Should I cut the strings off or does it need some sort of tie to maintain shape?,I’d say cut. Mine was taped at the bottom &amp; I cut it off

Some leaves are dying, and I’m not sure what it needs! Is the light too strong? Does it prefer more humidity? What should I do?","I know they like more humidity and moist soil, maybe increase watering to 3x weekly to maintain moist soil. I know that sounds excessive but Terra cotta pots will dry out them out quicker :)"
294638,t3_sepmia,My “newly” acquired plant that was about to get trashed. What is it and how can I rehab and take care of her?,"Looks like a schefflera. You could pop off a few of the poorly looking leaves, give it a good misting once in a while, but otherwise looks pretty healthy.  You could (if you wanted) also top it a bit to encourage more bushiness unless you like the columnar form. We had one in our yard in California that grew about 5 feet a year, probably maxed out at about 25-30 ft tall with branches 6"" in diameter."
31899,t3_de69ks,"After I repotted my new plant, it's been droopy. The new leaf was light before it unfurled when I bought it. I asked the shop and they advised moving it away from my window in case it was cold, and watering it.

How do I deal with the infection, and should I be worried about it spreading to other plants in the apartment?","Yes it is an olive tree and yes it is scale. I don’t have problems removing scale, it always shows up on my citrus, I just use some soapy dishwater with rubbing alcohol and they come right off. Rinse the plant at the end and you’re done."

Is this normal or is there something I can do?,"This does happen occasionally in the wild, these types of plants don't have any chlorophyll to photosynthesize so they either just die off or become parasitic by connecting to a nearby established plants root system and basically just steals nutrients so it can continue to grow.

But now these bottom leaves are turning yellow and a few of the tips are starting to turn brown. The soil feels dry now.

The bottom leaves do tend to yellow and fall off my dumb canes every so often, it's pretty normal.
When the soil is dry you're probably good to water it as long as there's good drainage :)

Is this indicative of anything? already dealing with spider mites on this dude - is it anything to do with that?,"Those look like harmless centipedes to me. Did you buy it from a Home Depot recently? They are notorious for not taking care of this plants and just flooding them with fertilizer so they look beautiful and green. This results in an unhealthy plant that is susceptible to infestations. If this is the case, return it PDQ. I tried to save a HD plant a few years ago and it wiped out like a quarter of my plants. It was awful."

231541,t3_o8masv,"Got this little guy from Lowe's for $0.25 because it was dying. Gave it a good drink (was bone dry and squishy) and sat under a grow light, any more advice?",No I think you got it. Water when soil is dry and give as much light as possible. That’s pretty much it for these. $0.25 is a great score though. Some of the “dying plants” at Lowe’s aren’t really dying and are more so physically damaged or blemished. You can find decent things there sometimes

182340,t3_lqzm9u,"Help me help this poor baby. I found her thrown in to the garbage, and I don’t think she’s garbage. Can someone please tell me what she is, and what to do?",I would repot her with fresh soil and inspect the roots to cut any soft brown part. Water it until water comes out of the drainage holes and until the pot is heavy so you can be sure it has enough water. Place it in bright indirect light. Wait for it to be totaly dry before watering again since they like to dry between watering. Remove the yellow leaves as they turn brown and crispy. In a couple of months it will be setteld and you will be able to cut the long vines without leaves and propagate them to have even more plants.

The wilting leaves and bruising are signs of root rot.
If the roots are black and mushy cut them off and rinse the root ball with water and if possible dip them or spray them with an antifungal then clean and disinfect the pot and plant it back with new soil. 
If it’s not root rot then it can be a fungal infection but it doesn’t look like it to me either way you can spray the leaves with antifungal solution."

Will that kill it?😰 when is the best time to water?,"I don't think that the added water will necessarily kill it, as long as there is a good amount of light so the plant can use it up effectively. But if I am ever worried that a plant is over watered, I like to throw a small towel or paper towel underneath the pot and let it sit for an hour or so and see much water is leached out of the soil. If the towel is wet I'll replace it with a dry one until the moisture being pulled out is very minimal."

Should I re-pot into a bigger pot?","Hey, browning edges are usually pretty normal in these plants, I think your plant looks great. One thing that could influence it is if you use filtered/distilled or tap water. If the water is ""hard"", these plants are not so equipped to deal with the extra salt, minerals, and they gather in the leaves' edges, causing a burn."

The plant is not large enough to need to be moved to a larger pot. If the roots bother you they can be trimmed. Do you have more propagations you can start? A larger pot needs more plants to fill in the space.

the flowers eventually die off like that. feel along the flower stem, along to the plant and it should just pop off if you apply a little pressure to where it joins.

Try not to wet leaves or blooms when watering. 

over watering effects look a bit like underwatering. stick your finger in the soil up to second joint of your finger, if it's dry- water it, if its wet -leave it. 

remember to feed every two weeks with a multipurpose fertiliser when it's blooming to keep the flowers going."

I have heard of people being able to grow from spent nodes but it is *very* rare that it will. You could keep it potted just in case? But if I were you I would cut my losses and move on to the next plant to give it love.

210720,t3_n657eg,I was repotting my Monstera Deliciosa and I noticed these things that looked like tiny eggs all over the roots. Does anybody have any idea what they are or how to deal with them?,"Fungus on your roots can actually be beneficial! Mycorrhizae is the symbiotic relationship between fungi and roots: the fungi get nitrogen and phosphorus and the roots get better water absorption and additional nutrient uptake.

Basically, if your plant is still healthy you don’t need to worry."
293816,t3_sc3o07,How do I get my Swiss cheese plant to fill in? All I have is one long long vine? Is it time to repot?,"First off, any climber getting leggy indicates that it isn't getting enough nutrition. Give it more light and change the soil in the pot. Also, Monstera varieties propagate easily with cuttings so take a few from this one and propagate to make more vines. Then you can plant them together in a bigger pot. Look up how to take care of this species, they aren't the most demanding so if you get the basics right plant will flourish."
140231,t3_ji0gr3,"Questions about this Golden Pothos! The soil feels bone dry, but when I water, it drains immediately and never seems to get the chance for the roots to get to it! A few of the leaves have been yellowing and dying. Does it need a bigger pot, maybe?","It could be a few things.

The potting mix may have become hydrophobic, this means it's not absorbing water very easily anymore. 

It could also mean the potting mix is a very quick-draining mixture. 

There also just might be so many roots that they take up all the space and there isn't a lot of available absorbent material left.

I would try to bottom water it. Remove it from it's hanger and set it in a large dish of water. Let it absorb up into the material, then rehang. Alternatively, you could certainly give it a new pot with fresh potting mix, but if the potting mix you have available is the same stuff you used in this one, you may want to test hydrating it in a bowl to see if the whole bag is old/hydrophobic."

255665,t3_pf75ie,What would be causing the spotting on my Birkin leaves? I don’t see any pests. Does he not like my water?,I went into my local indoor plant nursery recently to ask this same question about my Birkin. From what I was told the spots are normal for Philodenrons because of the guttation process in which they push water &amp; minerals through their leaves. The minerals are what cause the spots. This can be a sign of overwatering if there is a increase of spotting. Hopefully that helps 🙂
236208,t3_ogv02u,Is something wrong or am I just stupid? What's up with my cactus. He started to grow green part on left side of it a few months ago. It started to grow really fast. Am I suppose to support it with something or cut that part and plant it separately?,"So I'm not sure, but I think that flower is grafted onto a dragon fruit. If it is dragon fruit, you can cut that off and grow it from cuttings."

Is it anything to be concerned about?","Steve looks remarkably healthy considering the cramped conditions he’s got!!  Often plants that have grown past the widow will start dropping all their lower branches.  


Looks like air roots are popping out in the stem.  Nothing to worry about, leave them alone.  Steve looks happy so I am not saying to do this, but IF you hacked Steve’s trunk into two inch bits, and put them in damp soil, you’d easily propagate many Baby Steve’s."

202111,t3_mrb51x,"What kind of beetle is this? Found 3 in total in the of my philo micans, they’re quite small and blackish. Are they damaging my plant or should I leave them?",It could be a baby wood roach.  They like the moisture and I sometimes get them living under my pots and in them.  You could see if there are egg cases around.  They are black little cylinders.  They don’t really bother the plant but are kind of gross to have skittering around the house. Diatomaceous earth sprinkled in the soil should help.

Is there anything more I can do?",It’ll come back. You may lose some leaves but it will be fine. I did this to mine back in the summer when I left it in a hot room and forgot about it. Mine was way worse than this lol. I lost all but two tiny leaves. It has all new growth now.

I have been watering it every day...but there may have been a day or two a week where I'd forget to water it. How can I fix this?,You should definitely water it less often. It looks overwatered that's why the leaves are turning yellow. Try to water it when the soil at the top dries out. For now let it dry out completely and remove the yellow leaves. Good luck😊

Is something wrong?,"You can't save the bottom. You're going to have to make a clean vertical slice above the brown and let the cutting callous over by drying it out. Once the cut area is dried out, you can plant it in cactus potting soil. Just make sure to get a well-draining pot because cactus hate wet soil and need for the soil to dry out completely. A terracotta pot makes this easier, but make sure it has a drainage hole if you do get a terracotta pot."

These were not there last night, did I mess something up?",Looks like aphids and spider mites. I don’t know if it’s better to call it a loss but definitely isolate it from other plants. You could try spraying it with soapy water or rubbing alcohol and wiping them off the plant or hose it down to push them off the plant. Spider mites are the worst from what I hear. The white ones may be thrips it’s hard to tell but the black ones definitely look like aphids.

Stop watering it and put away the pot in a cupboard or similar for 6-8 weeks or until it's a little cooler, then bring it out and water lightly. It should regrow. If you want to propagate it, dig up the root when you bring out the pot and cut it up in pieces and plant seperately before you water, they should all grow into new plants"

I think its because I over fertilised or over watered?,"I started having this with watering too much. Wait until the soil is dry 2” down to water.

You may also want to make sure that she’s in a well-draining soil. Does the soil stay damp for almost a week after watering? You may want to consider re-potting if so."
4442,t3_9vzbku,"I’m a learning plant daddy. My Ficus Ginseng has leaves falling off constantly, I water it once a week @1 Cup. Any ideas??","Don’t water based on volume. You want to soak the soil, don’t leave it sitting in the flow through, and let it dry maybe 1-2 inches (depending on pot size)before watering again. You want your plant in a space with proper airflow and sunlight, look up the requirements for your plant to get a good idea of where in your home is best for it. Ficus are fairly finicky so if you do end up moving it it’ll drop leaves, just let it acclimate."

Can it be stopped?,"As someone else said, it’s probably from overwatering. These guys are soo easy to overwater and are always so dramatic about it. I put mine mine in a really chunky potting mix in a terracotta pot, meaning it will drain easy and the terracotta will let the roots breath- if you do decided you’re gonna repot it, might want to wait til spring, when it gets a bit brighter and warmer."

 It happens a lot to epiphytic aroids; they grow away from the light source because in their natural habitat they would be 'looking' for a tree's trunk to climb up to the top to get more sun, but living in a house, the plant wouldn't posibly know that it will never reach the top that way. 

Without firmly staking the plant and moving it closer to the light or to a better lit spot eventually the plant will get more vine -y and posibly revert to a more juvenile form, but if you really want to keep it maybe hold it with strings from the ceiling, hahah."

100040,t3_htt9cd,My friend is distraught and has lost a few plants already..she has hundreds of plants collected over 15yrs. Somebody help! What is this???,"That doesn’t look like scale to me. If you google photos of what scale typically look like you’ll see they are round insects that protrude from the stem or wherever they’ve attached. This looks like flat, large brown spots. My monstera has some spots like this. I believe it’s normal and nothing to be concerned about. It is possibly edema caused by excess watering. Sometimes when the plant takes on too much water too quickly some of the cells burst and form these corky growths. If it’s getting a lot of spots like this your friend may want to re-evaluate her watering schedule. Most plants need to dry out a little between watering.

Edit: Also just wanted to add that I did some googling and apparently there’s a part of the plant that is called the geniculum which connects the leaf to the stem and allows the leaf to “move” in order to follow the light. If you google monstera brown crust you will see many images of this. I think it’s commonly mistaken for pests but is a normal structure of the leaf."
253503,t3_pb7f0e,Posting behalf of my friend. Their calathea started to look like this after they repotted it. How can we fix it?,"If it's been like this for so long, it's not going to just recover, and it's not just transplant shock. It shouldn't be in terracotta, so this may be an ongoing issue. Calatheas dry out too fast for terracotta pots, and anything flopped over lacks the water for the stems to stand up stiff and healthy. It may be underwatered because if terracotta, or it may be not taking up the water in the soil due to root rot. Plants are more susceptible after repotting, so the repot might've started it. It needs tipping out and the roots checking for rot, anything black or slimy cutting off, and repotting in a good, airy houseplant mix in a plastic pot. Good luck with it!"

52973,t3_fgh2b1,Question: What are the pros and cons with introducing earthworms into the soil of potted houseplants?,"I used to do vermiculture and use compost for my houseplants. Worms were part of the deal. 

Pros: Worms improve the soil. 

Cons: Worms need a certain moisture/consistency to survive. Conditions in a plant pot can change quickly. If your plant gets too dry, the worms die. If you water a plant full of fresh worm corpses they rot. This is not pleasant. If you get your plant too wet, the worms go looking for better conditions, and you find shriveled worms everywhere. 

Long story short: I have found some tough survivors in really big (10 gallon?) pots. Nearly impossible to keep the little buggers alive (and in the pot!) in anything smaller. 

Recommendations: Set up a vermiculture. Use worm casting to fertilize house plants."

Any idea what could be happening?","My peps get wrinkly leaves when the water isn’t getting to the plant. Their roots tend to be very fragile and thin, so when potting them mix half normal potting soil with half succulent mix, if you can. I know there’s a lot of YouTube videos out there saying that they like to dry down all the way, but I personally haven’t found that true because the thin roots end up drying up and sometimes not recovering. I bottom water and let the pot decide how much it’s going to take, and dump out the rest when it’s done. I do this when the pot feels like it’s 50% dry.

191291,t3_m826st,Just noticed slight white patches on some parts of my rhapiadora tetrasperma. Is this the mosaic virus or variegation?,"The second picture definitely looks more like mosaic virus. 

I believe if you cut off the infected areas (with a  sharp, sterilised tool and sterilise the tool after to prevent further spread) and try isolate the plant, keeping an eye on it to see if any more appears. This is if you want to risk keeping it at all, you can’t get kill off a virus and it won’t just disappear, so if cutting it off doesn’t work there is a chance it will stay or even spread to other plants. 

I would do a bit more research to double check before getting rid of it or cutting it up.

Tldr; definitely looks like mosaic virus to me, especially if the leaves were solid green and developed the markings over time."

* Start by hosing down the plant with water and wiping the leaves and stems with a wet washcloth to remove as many of the flies as possible. Do so away from other plants, if you can. 
* Then wipe the plant with horticultural soap. You can use simple dishwashing liquid diluted in water, if you want. Don't forget the undersides of the leaves, which as you can see is where they like to feed the most.
* Repeat in a few days, and then again as needed to control the population.

The soil is not dry, I water regularly and the plant sits inside in bright light but never gets direct sunlight. I have searched every for bugs but cant find anything. What is going on?","I'm no plant professional, but it looks like you may have an issue more with some microbial infection (fungal, bacterial, or viral) than with just the amount of sunlight/water you're giving the plant -- I say that especially because of the leaf wilt at the top of the right picture.  That being said, it's not a death sentence, and even if it's not an infection, some experimentation could help you anyway.

Perhaps try re-potting the plant in fresh soil (gardenias like soil with a pH of about 5.0-6.0, preferably between 5.0-5.5, acidic! Very important!), make sure the pot has stuff drainage and that you're not over-watering it, try to not splash too much water on the leaves but instead directly on the soil, if possible increase the humidity (also kind of important!), and try spraying the plant with an anti-fungal solution (you can research these and make your own pretty easily).  Giving the plant a growing space in ideal conditions may entirely fix the issue, and if it is caused by an infection, ideal conditions can make less stress for the plant and help it fight the infection better -- just like if you had the flu, it's easier to fight off when you're staying home to rest with a bowl of soup, vs forcing yourself to go into work and act like normal!"

Let the cut callous (leave it on a shelf to dry) and then replant.

223278,t3_ntpo5j,"String of pearls was doing well, now dying abruptly. Anything I can do or should I just salvage what's left?","Yes. Cut away all the dead stuff. Freshen up the soil, a gritty peat mix is good stuff (on the heavier side, not too spongy), and lay your remaining segments of vine on top of the soil. Remember only to water when the soil is nearly bone dry and don’t let it stay dry for more than a day. Overwatering or overcompensating water after a too-long dry spell is a common issue for pearls, which leads to rot and can quickly decimate the plant. Often times you can catch it at this point, where it’s not quite all gone, and revive it. So you’re in good luck overall! Keep it in a very bright location without cold drafts, and it should bounce back with new foliage in as little as 2-3 weeks. It should have some strong roots again by then as well. Keep it out of direct sun and intense heat, but if you must have it somewhere hot then make sure you are balancing it’s water needs with that in mind. Make sure your pot has a drainage hole so the soil can breathe. If it doesn’t, transfer it to a nursery pot that you can place inside the decorative pot to better manage."

209061,t3_n2wv0e,My nan was going to throw this plant out after months of neglect. I took it hoping I could revive it or is it to late?,"It’s a yucca. 

You can fix it! It’s going to be scary though!

Get a shape pair of pruners and cut the whole top off about 6-8” above the soil. Trim off the dead leaves. Water it deeply and put it in bright indirect light. 

Then take the big chunk you cut off, cut the stem about 6” below the green part. Trim off any dead stuff. Stick that in a tall glass of water. In a few weeks it will grow roots and can be potted up by itself or back with its former lower half.

You can continue the fun by chopping up the remaining stem into 8-10” chunks. Trim off the dead stuff, keep the orientation as to what was the bottom of the piece and what was the top. Stick them, tops up, into water. If you’re lucky, they will grow both roots and new leaves and can be potted up to share with friends. 

When the new leaves grow, they will grow more upright like a broom. These older leaves will never go back up once they droop. 

Find it a sunny spot in your house, either full sun or bright indirect light, and keep it there, or put it outside for summer. Water when it’s dry. You’re more likely to kill it by overwatering than underwatering.  Turn the pot periodically to prevent leaning and bending.

I think your guess about overwatering is right because of the yellow. That happened to me once and I just allowed it to dry out and snapped off the yellow leaves once they dried up and she recovered well.

What do I do?","I would honestly take her out to see how the roots are. It’s super possible the much larger pot has not given her enough time to dry out between waterings and she’s developed rot. The leaves being limp doesn’t always mean they’re thirsty, it can also mean the roots are rotting and that’s not allowing the water to be absorbed correctly. The dark brown spots on the leaves also indicate possible rot. I would check just to be safe before watering more.

Edit: another sign that it has rot is if you give it a very thorough watering and the leaves don’t perk up after!"

Soil does become depleted and roots do become too overgrown for the pot.    

Slip the entire root mass out of the pot and have a look.  
If all you see is a ""wad of roots"" it needs to be repotted as there is nothing in there to hold moisture and nutrients.  

Be sure and use a potting mix designed for potted plants and straighten out the roots and even trim them if you need to.  
Use a new pot larger than the root mass but not by too much."

They have resources on care and can provide more specific help. From my limited knowledge, I can say the following regarding VFT care:
1. You need more well draining soil. Adding perlite to the soil will help, but make sure it is pure perlite without any added fertilizer (stay away from the miracle grow brand perlite)
2. Only water with rainwater. Maybe distilled water will do too, but absolutely no tap water. 
3. Do not trigger their traps until the plant recovers. Fastest way to kill a VFT is by needlessly triggering traps since they can only do so a few times before they die

Good luck!"

Water it thoroughly from the bottom (set it in some water, pot and all, and let the plant soak it up thru the holes in the pot for about 20 minutes or so). Water frequently enough to keep the soil evenly moist, but not soaking wet, so probably every 3-5 days, depending on conditions at your house. Give it a couple of weeks, and I’ll bet it will bounce back.

EDIT: Forgot to mention these plants like humidity. Set it on a saucer full of pebbles, and keep water in the saucer. The evaporation will create humidity."

I got neem oil that I will apply today to see if I can save it. This is the worst leaf that I will cut. Is there hope?","It's hard to tell if the plant is doomed. If there aren't as many contaminated leaves, you could still save the plant. Cut off all contaminated leaves and spray the rest (the soil as well. Or just completely repot it) with fungicide spray. Don't forget the stems. Quarantine your plant to avoid an outbreak on your other plants. Spray every few days for maybe 2 weeks. 
If you want to avoid hard fungicides, I heard that cinnamon can do the job. So eventually coat the soil with it.
If it comes back, it may not be a fungal problem but something else.
Hope this helps"

Doesn’t look horribly bleached, it actually looks really healthy to me. It’s putting out new growth even!

The webs are just regular spiders, not mites. You can just get a spade and cut the root ball like a cake and put your new piece in a separate pot with cactus soil.

Snake plants are low light tolerant, but they can also do very well in sun if they’re properly cared for.

The damage from lack of drainage can take years before showing up, so as long as it has soil refreshened every once in a while, plants can stay in pots without holes. It’s the toxic buildup of minerals over time that is the major problem with lack of drain holes.

I'm currently using predator mites on my rubber tree cause it had/has spider mites. You can tell the predators by their ""active searching"" behavior so if it is fast moving it could be a predator. However, where there are predators there could be prey. If you just bought a bunch of new plants at the very least I would give them all a welcome home shower with a lightly soapy sponge bath. This is my standard intake routine since the infected rubber tree came home and I wasn't on top of things. Also I would isolate new plants and watch then carefully for at least a month.

What is the cause?","I've actually had problems with pots with attached drainage plates like this. I find that there's usually not a ton of room between the plate and the hole, and the hole gets clogged with smaller particles of soil and hinders drainage. The attached tray also doesn't hold a ton of water, so if you're watering thoroughly, it's difficult to empty the excess out so the plant isn't sitting in water, if that makes sense.

I've repotted plants in these types of containers into pots with separate trays (so you can more easily monitor and empty any excess drainage) and had them bounce back to do much better. So that could be the culprit, given that all the other factors have been consistent between plants!

I also recommend unglazed terra cotta. You may have to water slightly more often, but it allows the soil to dry more evenly, especially in deeper pots.

I repotted it and it looks nice and perky again.  The soil in the nursery pot was just letting the water run straight through so my plant wasn’t getting any
366594,t3_yg3de3,This sprouted from my snake plant after having it over a year. It has sticky droplets on it. Any ideas what this is/is it harmful?,"Good news, your snake plant is flowering!

The sticky droplets are most probably ""happy sap"", which is a harmless sweet secretion from the plant. Just to be safe, check for signs of pests - some of them can leave a sticky substance too."

I've put it under the grow light since a few days ago, got hopeful when it looked like it was leaning to the light but since dropped more! :( What am doing wrong??","Might seem obvious, but that compost looks dry - have you watered it? Succulents seem to confuse people in that they think they don't need much water, so that leads people to completely neglect them. It needs a total soaking of the root ball, and then excess water poured away (or good drainage holes). 

In addition, these ones love lots of bright, indirect light - so yes, keep it in the sunshine. When they're super happy, they get red tipped leaves!"
187043,t3_lztbct,"Help! My croton has been losing leaves all winter and idk why. I bought it last spring and it was flourishing and growing extremely fast, and as soon as winter hit it started losing leaves. What do you guys think?","Potential issues:

- Watering schedule (croton should not be watered a whole lot in winter, but likes being watered a lot in summer, but of course don‘t overdo it so it doesn‘t stay with wet feet. *underwatering* in winter can also cause leaf drop)

- not enough light (croton needs to be kept in bright but not direct scorching sun conditions all year long). 

- cold drafts and room temperatures under 18 degrees Celsius can cause leaves to drop. Has it been near a window you open frequently, or standing in a chilly draft from a door?

- low humidity: has it been near a radiator?"

How much sunlight does it get?"
172836,t3_l99ffe,"My zz-plant has looked very healthy from start, but now the new leaves are brown.

Is it too soon to spray/water with a hydrogen peroxide solution to keep the rot away?","Hi! Not an expert but if you replaced some of the soil I’d let the plant heal for now. I used HP as a last resort on my pothos that had fungus gnats and black spots on the leaves (it is not as healthy as yours!), I guess it also killed the good bacteria in the soil because the plant basically collapsed.

137059,t3_jc8rj3,My roommate's prayer plant has some yellowing leaves. It's still pushing out new leaves and just flowered a few weeks back. Is it normal for it to lose some leaves or is something wrong?,"Not enough water and overwatering can cause the leaves to turn yellow and drop from the plant. If the leaves begin to turn yellow, water the plant less often if the soil is still wet or more often if the soil appears dry between waterings.

By far the most common Maranta prayer plant problems are caused by incorrect care. Bright lighting or excessive phosphate(manganese) or fluoride(iron) can cause leaf tips and margins to burn, leaving a band of yellow tissue between the healthy and dead tissues. Chlorosis causes yellow prayer plant foliage, especially on younger leaves.
chlorosis is a deficiency of iron or manganese, both of which are present but unavailable in high pH soils (pH&gt;7.2). Iron and manganese are needed by plants to form chlorophyll and to complete photosynthesis.

If your interested in reading up on prayer plant care,  I've made a ""complete"" maranta care guide on my page."

What do I do about browning tips and roots growing through the pot?,"I’d repot soon as you can and either cut the pot off or remove it verrrry carefully and slowly so you don’t damage those roots growing through. Pot it into another pot with drainage holes, One size up from the current pot, new well-draining soil. The browning tips could be due to being root bound, or from over/under watering, depending on the current watering schedule you have it on."

92073,t3_hjv8sg,My pothos cutting was starting to rot so I cut that part off but what should I do now to prevent further rotting? Does the black in the middle mean the inside’s already rotted?,"In my experience, when the bottom stem turns black, its rotting out. I dip the tip of my cuttings into candle wax before putting them in water. The wax temporarily seals the stem in, giving it a little more time to root."

Any ideas on how to save this guy?","I am no guru but I love my geraniums and seem to be able to keep them happy, so I'll give you my care-cocktail. Mine like quick draining soil and lots of sunlight and water. I have mine in either Terra cotta pots or baskets that have a coco liner so I can completely drench them every day and not worry about standing water, each of my plants will soak in about a gallon of water just by themselves. They love sun, and will give you loads of blooms if you stick them somewhere that gets at least 2-3 hours of complete direct hot sun. I have a spot on my porch that gets full sun literally from sunrise to sunset and it's huge. Lastly, they like to be aggressively pruned. Any stems that don't have buds (before they open the buds curl down ward) trim all the way down to where the stem originates from the branch, and if a stem has dead flowers and is getting new blooms ready under the ones already there, pick away any of the blooms that are dead / have lost all their petals. In my experience I pretty much just take away anything ugly, it's a prissy plant. It likes to be pretty."

Calatheas are very sensitive to what water they receive so many recommend distilled or rain water.
139034,t3_jfzat9,My stubborn mum wouldn’t listen and fed our flytraps a way too big spider. I don’t know what to do or what’s happening to it?,"Two things!

1. Cut off any black or rotting parts. It's normal for all the traps to go black after they've eaten, it's not a bad sign in these plants.
2. They don't like soil! It should be in moss mixture. Apparently the best thing for them is long fiber sphagnum moss. You can also put them in peat and sand mixture. The carnivorous plant group on Facebook loves to argue about the best method, but none of them contain soil. (Which is funny to me because all the ones I've gotten from the store come in soil...)

You're also supposed to use only rain water or distilled water because they don't like minerals, but to be honest I've been giving mine tap water and it's doing ok. And they don't like clay or terracotta pots for the same reason, it leeches minerals into the soil."

Great that you saw them now so you can treat your plant asap. Plenty of info online on.how to treat. I wipe them off with cotton swabs soaked in alcohol. Afterwards I spray with neem oil to get the ones that you don't see. Your plant should be fine because you caught them early.

Now that it is spring, will new leaves grow back at the nodes where the others died/fell off? Or is my only hope of getting her bushy again via trimming?","Unfortunately, pothos don’t regrow leaves from where they’ve dropped them. It’s also very common for them to drop the leaves closer to soil as they grow longer - the older a hanging pothos gets, the scragglier they tend look. Since each pothos plant only has a single vine, you’d have to give it a buzz cut to make it bushy. If you want a fuller plant, I suggest taking a few cuttings from the longer vines and planting the cuttings back into the pot. That way you can get a bushy appearance without sacrificing length."
309548,t3_tq88fk,Monstera got cold damage during 13F weather a couple weeks ago. Damage has nearly halted. What are the next steps I should take to help the plant recover?,Personally me I would go ahead and start taking off the most damaged leaves so that way the plant can focus on growing new ones leave some of them so the plant can photosynthesize

126575,t3_iu4g7g,"Help my bowl of zebra plants thrive!! I was recently gifted these and they seems overcrowded, extremely dry around the sides, and sunburnt. How do I make thrm happy? Should I separate them/report them?","So first things first, you want to pull them out of the pot and check for root rot. A lot of the symptoms you are having can be related to that. Trim off any brown or squishy roots and let the plants heal over for 2-3 days before replanting. (You can put them in separate pots or all together again) Give a good water and then leave it alone until the soil is dry. If the stem is starting to rot cut well above, ~3cm, let is heal and replant. Note, if you do have to do this, be very patient for new growth. The plant will be putting all it's energy into making new roots which on some haworthia can take several months, especially because we are entering the dormant period. If the roots look healthy and there are no squishy bits it is probably because they are big thirsty. Repot the little guys, wait 2-3 days for the roots to heal from repotting and then give them a good drink. 

As for the crunch bits, it is natural for some of the lower leaves to die off as the plant grows. Although these do look to be a bit accelerated due to improper care. The sunburns were most likely a result of the plant being introduced to the sun too quickly. When we overwinter (or buy them from somewhere where they weren't outside) we have to reintroduce them to full sun slowly. I leave mine in our north facing porch for a couple of weeks before moving them to partial and then full sun. 

And a final note on pots, soil, and watering, you'll want to find a pot with good drainage hole(s), terracotta is especially good because it wicks away extra moisture, and a loose, well draining soil. I personally use a ~1:1 ratio of the Expert Gardener potting soil from Walmart (it's more like tiny soft wood chips than actual dirt) and course sand. You want to have a gritty mix that falls apart after you squeeze it in your hand.

Watering is probably where most people go wrong with their succs. They tend to over love them and then we have a very sad plant indeed. (See afore mentioned root rot) I use the flood/drought method which mimics the native environment these plants come from. Basically water the little guy til the soil is saturated, let the extra drain off and then leave it alone until the soil is dry again. I tell people that buy succulents form my store that they thrive in sunshine and neglect!  😂

I know that was a wall of text, but I hope it helps you save your new plant babies and let's them thrive!!! 🌵🌵🌵"

In the smaller pot, the sides of the pot were holding them up. Do an image search for aloe and you see the bottom leaves flat out. especially as they grow big. When aloe get watered the leaves fill up and are heavy. So they fall over. They’re happy growing on their side. Aloe is actually a very big plant.

Though I can find BT online, I can't find BTi H-14, the variety for fungus gnats. Where can I get it?","Neem oil won't help you. Fungus gnats life cycle is all in the soil. Chances are you are keeping your pots too damp, allowing for fungus to develop and creating an ideal environment for fungus gnats.

Repotting, reducing waterings, and catching the adults as you are will eventually break the cycle. BT might not be needed."

Is this guy done for, or is there still hope for fruit this year???",Id make a new clean cut 3/4 below the top leaf.. then it should hopefully branch out for you from that joint on the second leaf down.. then i would make clean cuts on the stems in your hands and either stick them in soil and keep moist or propagate in water..

My spider plant tips will look like that when I'm over watering or when I repot to a pot that's too big. I've noticed spider plants like to be snug and a bit root bound. Maybe pull it out check the roots (for rot or bound) and size down a pot and/or pot it in dry soil
202487,t3_mrw9je,I was given a fiddle leaf cutting. What is the best way to root this thing? I was thinking of putting it in a jar w/ sphagnum moss then bagging it. Any tips?,I think you’ll have to pluck a few of those leafs off in order to be able to successfully root — that way it can focus more on rooting than promoting leaf growth. Definitely try the moss! Water lightly once and leave it alone for a good while

I probably trimmed off 10 yellow leaves by now with very little new growth. I only water when the soil is dry and it's in indirect light/verging on shade. Thoughts?,Most likely overwatering. Scindapsus are not tolerant of overwatering and only need to be watered once most of the leaves curl.

323494,t3_utqye2,"Hi, I found these eggs under my plants leaves. any idea what insects do this and how to get rid of them?","I am not totally sure, but those look like wasp eggs. The big hole would be where they emerged from. 

If they are wasps, they are likely benign or beneficial/parasitic. In which case you don’t want to kill them. There are a lot of different wasp species, and most of them don’t hurt people. 

Do you see any plant damage associated with these eggs? Was the plant outside or inside?"

i let my dracaena totally dry out before watering (otherwise it gets unhappy and starts to yellow). i think your plant will definitely appreciate the extra sun :)"
88492,t3_hevk3c,I got this beautiful Monstera for only $10 today. I’ve never had one before so I want to make sure I take care of her properly! What tips do you have to keep her growing big and strong? Does it look like she needs a bigger pot too?,"I do think that it could use a larger pot. The things that I think are most important are to a) don't mist the foliage and b) make sure that it gets enough light. For reference, I keep mine in an east window and it gets direct light all morning. I stress this because so many people deprive them of light. Any leaf that is rising more than 45° from the petiole is saying, ""more light, please!"" 

When you repot, be very mindful of not over compacting or over saturating the soil. Don't bury the base of any of the petioles in the soil or the leaf will yellow and fall off. 

Last tip: Prior to getting a moss pole, the aerial roots do an excellent job of supporting the plant. When they appear, you can guide them towards the soil if not already heading in that direction. It'll provide extra nutrients for the plant and help the foliage to grow really large. Best of luck!

She has them in orchid bark, gives them a good soak every two weeks (summer at the moment) and let's them dry in a nice warm and sunny spot.

159918,t3_kl2mfp,Dragon Tree/ Money Tree with white powdery spots which are starting to spread. What can I do/use to treat the plant?,Looks like mealy bugs. I would get neem oil to spray it with ASAP. It needs to get treated and make sure it’s isolated from the rest of your plants.

4074,t3_9ohv4x,Moved into a South Florida home with shrubs that have this. I tried gently washing with soapy water for 3 days but nothing. How can I get rid of the white bugs and black stuff?,"Your Schefflera has some type of mealbug or scale. The black stuff is black sooty mold which grows on the insect's droppings.

I'd find a systemic to deal with the bugs. Many of these insects have a waxy coating that makes them resistant to pesticides. A systemic is absorbed into the plant and gets them when they feed.

Once the insects are gone, the mold will clear up."

How can I save the plant?",Use a flashlight to inspect every inch of the plant for pests. This is not normal nor is it something you can ignore. I suspect it's sooty mold which grows on honeydew which is waste expelled from sap suckling pests.

Any thoughts?,"Try watering before it wilts. If jades wilt, it means they've depleted their substantial moisture reserves and need to replenish them, which is a stressful situation for the plant. Jade leaves should always be firm and plump. When you do water, make sure you give enough water to soak the entire pot, not just the top layers of soil. Water it when the top layers of soil are bone dry but you can still feel some moisture if you stick your finger into the soil"
156035,t3_kbv9ex,Is my golden pothos okay? Just noticed this yesterday after watering. Checked the pot and didn’t see it sitting in water. I water once a week. What are those brown spots all over?,"Even when there isn't any water in the pot, it could still be over watered. I would suggest feeling the soil and if it feels to moist or wet I would repot immediately. The longer it sits in that soil the bigger chance of root damage.

I know that brown spots mostly don't heal up, so maybe change the watering schedule so it goes a bit longer between watering."

It's not etoliated, this is just how they grow, like a tree with a trunk. I would give it as much light as you can though. It may have had other lower branches but dropped them due to lack of light. It tends to drop pads in the winter, sometimes the old pads get a bit floppy too. I keep mine in a heavy ceramic pot with a very porous potting mix. If you can put it outside for the summer I'm sure it will give you a lot of new growth (please acclimatize gradually if you do this)."

30413,t3_d8trk7,I've been trying to strengthen/grow this jade for a year. Should I be pruning differently? More often? Does she need a bigger pot?,these are quite the slow grower. You can spend it up by giving them cactus fertilizer if you wanted. Cactus and succulents have shallow roots so Repotting wouldnt do much at this stage of its life.
314731,t3_u66zog,I just realized that my plant is infested with those white bugs... I check all my other plants they don't seem to have them. What are they and how can I treat my plant?,Springtails.

Just sit in the bathroom and let them soak up your steam. 3-5 times a week.

I had a different species that had root rot and curled liked this after I cut away the rot and repotted it. I ended up finally leaving the pot in a dish of water overnight to really let the media get saturated and that made it perk back up. That was a few months ago, and said Calathea has a gorgeous root system now and have been putting out new shoots. It also was necessary to have it in a place with good light, temps, and humidity.

For what it's worth, I really like an African Violet type mix for my Calatheas. I have all of them in 2 parts potting soil, 2 parts peat moss, and 1 part pumice (perlite would also work).

I fine pilea are generally ok being a little rootbound and I like to keep some pups in the pot as the lower leaves on the parent plant will eventually die and leave a bare stem that gets hidden by the smaller pups

One was too far gone to keep on, the others I left on at first. After my monstera had put out some more leaves I cut the other ones too.

I would cut off all the pieces that have a green stem. Remove everything else from the pot, soil included, and pitch it. Then fill the pot with some succulent soil and about 40-50% perlite.

The mother leaves being alive doesn’t really mean much I don’t think, usually they will wither away after a while, passing their water and nutrients to the babies.

88059,t3_hecivb,"Can anyone suggest why my avocado leaves are going dark and crispy? I already had to get rid of almost all the leaves as they went brown, is this the end for it?","When you water it, use distilled and do it in your sink. Pour a ton in the plant until it comes out the bottom and let it drain, as it can be a nutrient buildup. Avocados need deep pots as their taproot goes really far down. I don’t believe this is over watering like others have said, but I would get a taller pot. I use a 5 gallon bucket and it’s a cheap easy solution. I had an avocado that looked like yours and it slowly died, even with a ton of effort I put into saving it. After it went, I started 12 avocados in tall glasses from the dollar store, and the first 3 that had roots hit the bottom I put in the 5 gallon bucket. I then added one that hadn’t started yet directly in the dirt, and they are all now the same. 

So I’ve got 4 avocados in a 5 gallon bucket and they’re flourishing. While 4 is a lot for one bucket, I’ve had much better luck keeping them together than when I’ve tried separated ones. I’m also doing different things to each one, cutting them back, stacking them, and how I’m treating them for pests.  

In short, that doesn’t have to do with your question but I’d get a much taller pot, not wider. Also start a few more. Make sure you start more than one to allow for errors, or ones that just don’t have the best growing genes. 

If you have any questions feel free to pm me :)"

If I'm not mistaken these plants grow on the floor of the tropical forest, hence their natural habitat would be warm, humid and no direct strong sunlight due to the thick canopy above them.

Try watering (soft/filtered/rain water) but not too much for the beginning, as the soil probably needs to rehydrate first. Keep it out of strong sunlight, but allow indirect or filtered light. A window facing east or west would probably be good.
Keep the humidity high by spraying it with water, keeping it close to other tropical plants or by putting the pot on wet stones/pebbles."

20770,t3_cfyd1a,What’s up with my monstera? Could it be lack of sunlight? Would leaving it by the window during grey days still help?,"My guess is it's overwatered. Monstera are pretty tolerant of low light, and if they're not getting enough light they'll typically put out non-fenestrated leaves and that's the best way to tell. With my monstera, she gets droopy like this when I over water or even she gets too much sun, but if you haven't put her in direct sunlight recently that's probably not it. 

I'm worried it's the water because that pot looks thick and I'm not sure if it has a drainage hole. I recommend taking the plant out and checking if the roots are mushy or tight and firm. If the roots are mushy at all, you should cut them off and repot. 

I only water my monster when the soil is almost fully dry, because they're very tolerant of being dry but HATE being wet."

Thoroughly water once a week or until the top inch of dirt becomes dry again and check underside of leaves/branches for strange critters

The yellowing leaf can be a sign of nutrient deficiency usually caused by the soil being to alkaline. pH check your water, and adjust to around 5.0-5.5 before watering to help bring maintain pH. Lemon juice or a tiny bit of pH down solution will help a bit in the short term.  Some sulfur slow-release pellets will probably be your long term solution?"

Ripping them off may damage the epidermis and the growing point and be a potential infection site, or just cause scarring.

Does anyone know what is wrong with him?,"The leaves of the jade plant , like all succulents, store a lot of water.  If the humidity of the substrate is too high, the leaves can no longer completely absorb the water and release it over the top of the leaves - they “sweats” this water, leaving behind white dots that are easy to wash off.  They don't harm the plant (the escaping moisture leaves white stains made of lime or salts). 

 If there are small white webs on the leaves in addition to the white spots, however, caution is advised.  In this case, it could be mealybugs .  These must be fought immediately.

 The white spots are not powdery mildew.  Powdery mildew appears as a white or gray coating, with individual dots cannot be seen."

205799,t3_mxigig,Help! was given this monstera a week ago and two leaves are doing... this? I have seen posts about it being overwatered but I haven’t actually watered it since I received it in the post?,"If those brown spots are not dry and crispy, it’s been overwatered. You obviously didn’t do it so I’m sure it’s a result of whoever you bought it from overwatering it so it will stay moist during its journey to you. Also, the yellowing that’s starting around the brown spots could mean that a fungal infection is starting. The fungus thrives on overly wet soil but! DO. NOT. PANIC!! It can be taken care of quite easily. 

If I were you, I’d get that baby out of that wet soil. Pot it up as you usually do and check the roots for darkness or mushiness. If you find either, just trim those parts off. You want to use all new soil to make sure it can dry out and to get rid of the fungus critters in your media. Give it some time to dry before watering again. Those roots need to rest after being over saturated and you examining them. Either use a moisture meter or just your eyes to determine when to water again. The plant will start to droop when it’s thirsty. Don’t let it go too long like that though. 

As for the leaves? They won’t turn green again so you’ll have to decide whether or not to cut them off if they bother your sense of aesthetic. If you don’t mind them, spray the plant down with a need oil solution or Bonide’s makes a great Copper Fungicide which won’t hurt your plant at all (and it’s organic!). Either way, you have to treat them bc that fungal infection won’t stop. It will continue to grow on those leaves. So, treat them to leave them or just cut them off. Monstera grow ridiculously fast has so losing 2 leaves is nothing. I’d do this sooner than later though.

None of this is hard. In fact, you could leave those leaves as a reminder of a great lesson you learned about your plant. It (and you) survived overwatering and lived to tell the tale. I have a couple of plants that I’ve done that with and I consider those leaves a badge of honor myself. It just reminds me of a struggle we (the plant and I) made it through together. You’ve got this! 🙌"

If it’s happening often it’s because it’s root bound in the pot and as a result of that the plant dries out quicker, though pothos as a plant are not super affected by root boundness, they will just need to be watered more often if you don’t feel like repotting it.

With a small watering pitcher I actually use a loose leaf tea infuser scoop so it’s not messy to pull them out of the water and it holds the measured amount. 

The trick I learned is you have to water ALL of your plants with this at the same time to get the most Gnat &amp; Larva Kill.  This is because the adults can still fly away when you’re treating so if all of the plants have this in the soil, the larva has less of a chance at survival.

You can place that root ball right into a bowl of lukewarm water, which will coax the roots into releasing the dirt on their own without you having to do it with your fingers - greatly decreasing the risk of transplant shock.

But everywhere that is still green is safe.
118425,t3_ii4s5t,This plant is starting to turn yellow and it doesn't have any new growth :( does it still have a chance to live or should I just throw it away?,"Is it a pothos? They are very hardy, I've had multiple leafless rooted pieces sprout leaves :). Definitely give it a chance, imo"
41979,t3_ei6scz,Pothos propagation question I've had good luck using full limbs but just read you can cut and root each node separate for a fuller plant to start. Which method do you use?,"I actually use hair pins instead and dont cut them at all. I take the viney part, stretch out a hair pin, find a bald spot in the pot, and pin the vine down where the leaf sprouts out. I pin each node down but not too hard, just enough that it doesn't move and is secure in the dirt. That part of the plant will grow roots from those nodes and start pushing more leaves out, you'll get a bushier plant.

Edit: a word"

Lower leaves drop off rubber trees all the time because they don't get enough light/are old. You should be worried if newer leaves towards the top have started falling off. Also, rubber plants generally tell you when they are starving for water, so you could probably wait a bit longer before watering if you are worried!

The spider mites will be the best place to start, then replant it in fresh soil and if you use the same pot wash it with soap and water. Then give it a nice soaking and give it more light. You can also cut off any dead growth when you repot it.

My initial guess is powdery mildew or mineral deposits left after watering from the top wherever they grow them. Just try to wipe it off with a clean, damp paper towel first and see what happens. If it’s mildew, it might have caused some kind of fungal infection if it’s inside the leave, rather than just on the surface. This is usually caused by lack of airflow.

I heard I give a them good soaking but some other sites say wait a few days or week. Soooo...soak?,"I always splash water around the roots after repotting to make the soil swell and settle snuggly around the roots.

Maybe if it another week and if it continues declining at the same rate you might have to do something drastic. I would say that crunchy leaves means underwatering, but the soil looks pretty damp to me. 

Often when you get no answers it means people aren't confident enough to offer a solution, due to an uncommon plant or unusual condition."

How can I get this one back on the right track?,"Aerial roots are no big deal, the plant uses them for support and to get moisture from the air. I prefer to guide them back into soil but ymmv.

I'd remove it from the soil and check the roots. Remove anything papery or mushy. It likely needs a bigger pot. Bigger pot with a well draining soil mix to start (mix of potting mix, orchid bark, perlite, maybe some worm castings, or Google your own) then put it somewhere brighter than it has been."
141397,t3_jk7n92,Most of the leaves got too crinkled and all I had to clip them off. It’s not growing any more new leaves. Did I over water it?,I think so.

Do you think I didn’t add enough soil or what can I do to help her ?,When repotting did you keep the root ball and previous soil or did you take off all the previous soil around the roots letting the roots naked for a few minutes ? Because you need to keep the previous soils otherwise it can stress the plant. I think the soil level is fine but your pot is 2 times too big which will encourage overwatering and slow the foliage growth down

You could do whatever you like tbh - leave it, or cut it. Personally I’d leave it, but that’s just me. If you look at photos of large/mature burro tails you’ll see no strand is perfect but as the plant fills out the imperfections become less noticeable. 

You mentioned it hurts to lose leaves. I feel that! Once in awhile I’ll look at mine wrong and it will drop a few. I set them in soil and mist every few days so I have mini burro babies growing :) it definitely makes losing leaves less heartbreaking plus you get a new baby plant out of it :)"

272862,t3_qhxs7k,Help! I received this as a gift &amp; dont know how to take care of her! Also is this a Bird of Paradise?,"Congrats! You are the proud new owner of a bromeliad. They are very easy to care for. 

They're quite happy in indirect light. Watering is a little counterintuitive: you actually water directly on top of the plant, *not* on the soil. (They are epiphytes, and are evolved to grow on tree branches in jungles.) The little cups in between the leaves catch the water and it drinks the water that way. They're practically impossible to overwater; just keep it watered such that there is always a puddle in the leaf cups. 

Eventually the big red flower in the center will die, and once it is dried out you can cut the flower off. This plant will become the ""mother plant,"" and soon you may see smaller ""pup"" plants springing out of the leaf cups. The mother plant will never flower again, but it will support the pups as they mature. The pups will eventually flower, and then may become mother plants too. Eventually, you may want to split the pups off of the mother plant (they're great for the flower bed, or for regifting!) but it's recommended that you do not separate the pups until they are at least 1/3 the size of the mother plant. 

If you plan to keep it outside, just keep an eye out for baby mosquitos in the warmer months. One of my bromeliads inadvertently became a mosquito nursery this way, as the standing water in the leaf cups can become a breeding ground for mosquitos. If this happens or you would like to prevent it, you can spray neem oil once a week in the leaf cups. This is safe for the plant and will kill the mosquito larvae."
3616,t3_9fbwit,This is a burn from neem oil (had a scale infestation a few weeks ago) on my ficus elastica. I already pulled a few leaves that were worse off. Is this guy doomed or can he recover?,"Scale can be stubborn, and may require repeated applications. Don't apply neem oil when the plant is receiving direct sunlight, it can burn the plant, and always follow the correct dilution instructions (if necessary) on the label. Just like read and follow the label, all that tiny writing. 

As long as the plant is putting on new growth, things are going in the right direction."

Let cool and strain into a spray bottle. Shake before use.

Otherwise, I'd suggest planting marigolds next to whatever you don't want eaten. This is a bit do as I say, not as I do, because I've never done it (""but I could plant more food there instead!"" is always the argument that wins in my stupid head)"

Is she okay?,"Fuzzy roots are fine unless there is a patch of fuzz that wipes off, then it's mealy bugs.  This doesn't look like mealy bugs.  Planterina had a good video on YouTube about calathea care, but there are generally 2 possible causes of brown spots: low humidity or the wrong water.  Calathea are very sensitive to sediments in tap water, so if you are using tap, you will need to switch to distilled water or rain water.  As for humidity, calathea like it to be more humid than is generally comfortable for a house.  You can do a humidifier next to it or a pebble tray under the pot."

- If you have healthy leaves without roots, roots can grow easily. Cut the base of the leaf in a ^ form. Do a water propagation, change the water every weeks, repoot when you have news roots.

If it’s soft and turning black then you need to behead the plant. If it’s solid and green then you don’t. 

Either way this needs to be reported in a fast draining soil, 50% cactus soil and 50% perlite. The soil it is in is retaining too much moisture. And DONT water until the leaves start to wrinkle. You can’t water these plants on a schedule. 

Also a north west window is not going to cut it for this kind of plant. They need tons of light or they will start to stretch out. You will want to find a higher light and slowly acclimate it to prevent sunburn."

300817,t3_sxffjf,Just picked up my first pothos and unwrapped a vine and noticed all the yellowing leaves maybe aerial roots? Two leaves have holes too. How do I keep this new babe healthy and thriving?,"She looks healthy :)

You've got a ""golden"" pothos. That yellow is variegation, and is cultivated for. If the yellow keeps spreading (like, a leaf that is half yellow becomes full yellow) then you should worry, but variegated leaves start and stay partly yellow (though they can turn fully green if not given enough light - called reversion). The aerial roots are also normal - they are how pothos cling on to trees and grow up them in the wild. If you laid it on your wall it might start growing the air roots up your wall and climb it  (and take off your paint). You can trim off the aerial roots if you don't like them, but I let my pothos keep theirs so they can climb. You can also put that vine in the dirt and the air roots will grow into the soil (makes it easier to propagate).

The two tiny holes might have once been insect bites or tiny amounts of damage, but they seem old and small. I wouldn't worry about them unless more start showing up."

You can prop by leaves or sometimes I just stick  the cuttings right back at the pot lightly and give about week or 2 not watering but misting little bit and they grow from there.  You can also cut in half of that to make it short so it can sit on soil easily.

They rot very easily if there's too much moist in the top part of soil. they can survive without watering by using moist and nutrition stored in their fat leaves"

Window faces west, too much or too little sun?","I never answer these help threads because there are so many people here that know so much more than me. But I’m going to give it a shot. I’ve had peace lilies forever. Here’s what I know. They need a lot of water and you can’t really water anything on a set schedule. They also like light a lot. Just not direct cause their delicate leaves will scorch. But if you let them dry completely out and then water hard, they get stressed out. A pot with drainage really is important. Yours look a little nutrient deprived. They don’t need a ton of fertilizer, but some. Repotting is not just for upgrading size, it also means that your nutrient depleted soil is replaced. And it means that the soil isn’t compacting the roots. 

I’ve had houseplants for a long time before general public knew so much about growing and before internet so info wasn’t readily available. I did what my grandmother did. I watered them when they needed watering-with tap water-until the water ran out the bottom, repotted once a year, fertilized in the summer with an all purpose fertilizer, kept them by a bright window, wiped the leaves with a damp cloth sometimes, and occasionally poked around in the dirt with a stick to loosen it up. That’s it. 

I am grateful for all the knowledge because people are getting more plants with specialized needs. But, the basics still work."

14122,t3_bwuzaq,My tomatoes were doing just fine until I noticed this. Blossom rot? How do I prevent this from happening to my other fruit on the same plant?,"Yes, probably blossom end rot.  It's a physiological disorder of calcium transport, but it's not (usually) caused by a lack of calcium in the soil. It's tempting but I wouldn't just add a ton of gypsum or lime to the soil or use a foliar spray. It's always better to narrow the cause down.   Here comes the flow chart..

Generally the first thing to look at is water fluctuations-has it been very rainy or cold lately?  If the weather's been great, check whether you're over or under watering. Yes, both. If the weather's been great and you're watering carefully, are you feeding a very high nitrogen fertilizer?  If no, what's the soil like in your garden? Could the pH be drifting?"

3247,t3_97pho3,"They are getting lighter, start hanging and the ends are getting harder (bit wood-like). What can I do to save him?",Your plant is etiolating. It needs more light.

20269,t3_cerfta,I'm new to succulents. Woke up this morning to this guy fallen over and looking sad. He's normally very happy and has been growing a lot lately. How do I help him?,"Hello! Does that terrarium have any drainage? If not this is likely the issue, succulents don't like to be sitting in moisture, otherwise they rot very easily.

Your best bet would be to repot in a terracotta pot with a good drainage hole, in a 50/50 mixture of cactus soil and perlite, or another well draining mixture of your choice. Make sure to check the plant for rotting while you do this.

Only water when your plant asks for it. Soil should be bone dry, and the leaves should be on the slightly squishier side. At this point you can water thoroughly and let it drain, while trying not to get too much water on the plant itself.

If you would like the plant to grow more compact, it needs more light, it's quite etiolated right now.

Good luck!"

10920,t3_bnbrhw,Got this cactus a few days ago and I was just wondering if there is anything wrong with it and what type of a cactus is it?,"Go to r/cactus and ask there. Some cacti kind of turn to bark like a tree trunk at the base as they mature so only the tops are green, but if this one is actually dying, you can always chop off the tops towards the bottom of the green part, let them dry out for a couple weeks, and then re-pot them in cactus mix soil and they will be fine.

Also the brown blotches on the green part are probably just old sunburns. Cactus are pretty hardy but they can get scars if they get put in the sun too quickly without acclimating them to full sun first."

Was it shipped? Best practice is to water the plant fully right before it's shipped, so that's probably all. Otherwise, it was watered just before you got it. Staghorns need to be kept fully moist. Don't break up the root ball, or do anything else invasive, simply because a plant is wet.

I don’t think it needs a plant light. I have mine in bright indirect light. Mine is a regular green one, so I’m not sure about the red variety, it’s been a while since I had one that color, but some of those pale leaves make me think maybe it got over watered??

Water?,"Spider plants will continue to grow roots despite it running out of room and choke itself out. If it’s been in that pot for a while, and you haven’t really changed anything, you might wanna pull it out and check the roots. If you see that there are a lot of roots, you have two options (options are nice!). 
1. Take it out of the pot and tear a bunch of the roots off.. and by tear I mean cut and or hack with a shovel. You could probably take about 1/3 of the roots off. Add additional soil to replace the area where the roots were. After this if you noticed some of the leaves dying, that’s fine. It’s just doing this to account for the change in root size and will stop.
2. Rather than tearing the roots off, take a shovel or something similar and split the plant in half. Repot the other half, and now you have two spider plants! Overtime it’ll fill out and look for like it does in this picture. 

You could do option one if you don’t have a pot handy, then start looking for a pot so that when it does this again, you can then split it in half.

Edit: I did this recently to my spider plant. I didn’t have two large pots, but I did have four smaller pots. So I split it in four. Now I have four spider plants. 😅"

These plants can go with very little water as theyre prone to root rot so a very chunky soil mix is preferred. These plants will do completely fine with very little light. You'll see when they want more light when the new leaves become smaller and smaller or when its begging for light and making only internodes. So i think your plant either is under or over watered so please go and pull it out of the pot and have a root inspection.

What kind of dish ""soap"" did you use? Does it have the word ""soap"" on the label, or does it say ""dish liquid"" or ""dish detergent""? And why did you use it? Detergents and dish liquids don't work like true soaps, plus they usually have other ingredients in them that aren't needed and may harm plants (don't know if that's what happened to yours, but it's possible). 

It's easy to fix that - just get a little bottle of unscented Dr. Bronner's or a small bottle of Safer Soap. They are very concentrated, don't ever go bad, and you don't use that much so it's well worth getting the real thing that is known to work."

I've noticed it hasn't been the same after I fertilized it, could it potentially be fertilzer burn?","All of that redness is root rot from overwatering. You're gonna have to cut all of the rotted roots away and start from scratch. Don't leave any roots behind or it'll spread again. Once you've gotten rid of the rot, water prop it and change the water frequently. It'll take a while before new roots can grow again but it's the safest method. 

Also, you'll have to get rid of that soil too because it's what caused the root rot. Snake plants like soil that dries fast and die quickly when they sit in moisture. Throw out the old soil and repot in a mixture of indoor potting mix with cactus soil. Only repot once it's grown enough roots, otherwise it'll die again lol. This process can take a couple months. To avoid this from happening again stop overwatering, snake plants like to be more dry than being watered on a schedule. I water mine once every 1-2 months and it's popping out babies. Good luck!"

Don't worry, but Avos are really succeptable to it.
If you don't water it deeply the salt builds up on the top layers of the soil and the Avo, which normally lives in salt deprived soil, sucks it all up eagerly.

The way to avoid it, every month or so, take your pot into the shower or sink and water the crap out of it, like, really drench it, so that water is flowing out the bottom drainage hole and let it all run through. Then let the soil dry out almost totally before watering it again.
Mine are in 18liter pots and I use at least 16liters of water to flush it through.

You may want to add some kind of mild fertiliser to the water to make sure you haven't washed all the nutrients out too, I just use water from my aquarium which is full of goodies the avos love.

Another tip if you go this way, every 3months or so, I add some used (cold) coffee grounds to the surface of the soil, helps fertilise and keep the soil acidic!

Hope that helps"

Any ideas?","Brown spots on the leaves could be many things, but my main guesses here are salt/mineral build up from tap water, really dry air, inconsistent watering, or insufficiently low light. I would recommend a close inspection of the roots, making sure none of the plant it rotting, using Neem oil or diluted hydrogen peroxide spray to fend off any potential bacteria, you could also soak the soil in a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution and kill all bacteria in the soil. (This kills good and bad so you only want to do this once every six months if at all). I'd also recommend a close inspection of all the foliage, inspecting for pests. I've definitely had my fair share of gnats and spider mites, though for this I'm at a loss."

The problem is once root rot sets in it's sort of is like you're underwatering because the roots can't take water up. The plant can start to look like it's not getting enough water because it's not actually absorbing anything.

It was going pretty good, growing a bunch of leaves, but now they're yellow and the trunk is soft. I dug it up to check for root rot but I have no idea what I'm doing?","Some of those roots look okay, but some might have root rot. It is hard to tell from the picture, but if you have been keeping it constantly moist, it probably has root rot. If there are brown, mushy roots, where the outside slides off to expose the thin white inner part, then you have root rot. You can try cutting off those dying roots, and all mushy brown parts, let it dry out on the counter for a few days, and then replant it in fresh soil. It still might not live.

When you replant, water the (well draining soil) deeply, and don't rewater until the soil is completely dry. The caudex should look wrinkly and feel soft when it is ready for a drink. 

Adeniums like full sun, and drop leaves kind of frequently, so those yellowing leaves could just be because of a cold draft or something. However they also drop all their leaves and go dormant when it gets colder, so maybe that is it. Or, ya know...root rot.

Good luck!"

When they die, the bract begins to die, and then the plant either stops growing or dies too. Bromeliads only flower once, but it should produce offshoots as the bract dies. This can take months.

Other problems such as excess direct sunlight have you seen the light conditions threw out the day to see if it’s getting to much light? Remember where they live in the wild.

The one thing I can say is that this needs more light. See how the top growth is very small and there's a long distance between each node? That means there's not enough light, so the plant is stretching to try to find enough.

When you repotted, did you pot it up into a much larger pot than it used to be in? That can cause root rot from overwatering because the volume of soil holds more water than the root system is big enough to use quickly.

Panic a little first. Isolate your plants asap. 

Then fill a spray bottle with 10% denatured alcohol, 10% green soap and 80% water to make environmentally friendly insecticidal soap. Spray the plant daily until all of it is dripping with the stuff, especially the folds and underside of the leaves. Keep with it for at least three weeks. The thrips lay their eggs inside the leaves/stems so you need to stay on it if you want to eliminate the thrips forever.

It helps to read up a bit on their life cycles, since the pupae are like tiny white/yellowish worms and adult thrips are like tiny black flies.

With all succulents you should water thoroughly, but infrequently: Water the plant until all the soil is saturated and water pours out of the drainage holes.  Wait two minutes and water again until water pours out.  This ensures that the soil is saturated.  Then put the plant in a bright sunny spot, and let it dry completely. This can take a month or more.  Then repeat. 

 Aloe leaves should be plump, and not concave.

Oh! And to address your original question - you can certainly add soil to cover the bare stem, but the best thing to do to get ‘rid’ of the stem is to cut the plant off, and re-pot it, letting it grow new roots.  But I would wait for the plant to recover before cutting it because this aloe has very little ‘in reserve’."

Can someone please tell me what I did wrong and how I can save my little friend?","I don’t know for sure but my guess is that the other commenter was correct: over watering and it’s rotting. You could pull it out of the pot and see if it’s mushy on the inside. If so, there isn’t really anything you can do to save it. 

In the future when dealing with succulents and cacti, soil is REALLY important. Most of the time the soil it was grown in is no good and holds way too much water. It’s fine to be in that when it’s being grown in a 100° green house getting 14 hours of direct sunlight but not so great for someone’s house. I find it best to just make my own soil mix by combining regular potting soil with perlite and expanded shale, at a 3:2:1 ratio. It holds enough water to allow the plant to suck up some moisture, but drains fast enough to mostly prevent over watering

Edit. Okay just looked it up, this is a barrel cactus. If you pull it out of the pot and it is rotting, if the top is still good, you can behead it, let the wound callous over for a few days in the sun, then place it in soil and really don’t water it until you notice new growth, meaning it has regrown roots. If you do this, you want to make sure the part you remove doesn’t have any rot"

Drainage holes in pot? Loose soil? 4 to 6 hours light at least [ winter].
Jades like for the soil to dry out between watering. In the winter they take even less water.
If this soil has been moist over a long period ( or your not sure ) because it can be confusing I would take the pot off the Jade and check for root rot.

I have several palms and mites *love* palms, especially in Iowa winters with subzero Temps. I treated my entire 65 plant collection with Captain Jack's Deadbug Brew. I buy the concentrate and mix it myself, you get way more doses than one $10 ready to use bottle and it's always available when you become suspect and now don't have to run to the store and can dig right into the action. I rotated bathtub spraying daily by grouping plants together and treating them together in each group the entire 2-nearly 3 months. I had thrips. I sprayed palms, prayer plants, calatheas, philodendrons, 2 Boston ferns, pothos, scindapsus, syngogium, spider plants and succulents down every 3 days for the first week, twice weekly for the next 2 weeks and once a week for the duration of the time. I did repot because thrips are a bitch. I repotted in a single day (work remotely) and sanitized *every single pot.* I lost my parlour palm in the battle but (**RIP Ricky Bobby**) he succumbed to mites and thrips and I was over his moodiness as is.

How do I repot it without destroying the roots but without getting root rot?,Just plop it into a slightly bigger pot surrounded by soil! I’ve tried different ways and my plants always bounce back quickest if I leave the roots alone. Lots of people think they’re being helpful by ripping up the root ball but it really just causes unnecessary damage by severing lots of roots and root hairs. This one doesn’t look too rootbound either since you can see soil underneath so it will just keep developing its root system normally :)

one being the water you use to water it, apparently, avocado plants are sensitive to chlorine and salt, both of which can be in your tap water. Apparently, the solution is to water it with gallon jugs of distilled water, or rainwater. 

The other thing is fertilization. Apparently these trees like a lot of nitrogen, so you should use citrus tree fertilizer.

With light, they'll do better in high indoor light conditions but they can tolerate low light better than most plants, so when in doubt err on the side of low light, with the expectation that this will mean slower growth and less variegation.

I don't like rooting in water because those roots never seem to do well in soil, leading to longer than usual transplant shock. This might explain why you haven't seen much new growth as the plants are spending their energy on new roots.

Pothos are really resilient, and thrive off of neglect, so take that into account with your care - less is more and it is easy to ""love them to death.""

319100,t3_ui601f,"Peperomia rosso droopy after adding diluted fertilizer, is this normal or should I do something to stop her from getting worse?","The droopy leaves could be the cumulative effect of under-watering.

If you're only giving little dribbles on the weekend (every seven days), with the increase in seasonal temperatures (northern hemisphere), increase in foliage growth, production of flowers which are very resource-sucking intensive, substrate that is very well-draining or contains a lot of peat moss with those implications*....I think you are under-watering  the plant.

The timing of the fertilizer most likely had nothing to do with the leaf droop.  I fertilize my various plants (over 260 pots) including a peperomia all year round with a very weak dilution.

Watering weekly is probably fine, it just needs to be more thorough....make sure the soil is saturated.  You can try submerging the pot in a larger container of water filled with enough lukewarm that it comes to just under the surface level of the substrate. Leave for thirty minutes. Drain the pot well, also slightly tilt the pot as you might be surprised how much more water drains out. Note the weight of the pot before this bottom-watering and then afterward. Keep this in mind going forward, it's a quick way to determine if your plant need to be further evaluated for watering.

Learning your plants watering needs is an ongoing process and will slightly change with seasonal influences and growth.

*If peat moss is allowed to dry out, it has hydrophobic properties meaning it sheds water rather than absorbs. If this condition exists, water is running down the sides and the plant isn't getting adequate moisture.  It takes longer to hydrate dry peat moss but it can be done. You just need to check after watering for the pot to feel heavier and to check (this small pot) about a half to one-inch down to see if the substrate is moist.  If it isn't, add more water slowly.  Use lukewarm/tepid water."

If you can’t, get some sticky traps that will catch the adults. Neem oil is a good preventative measure.

What am I doing wrong?,"From when I got it maybe two months ago, I've had it hanging near my north-facing bedroom window but when it started to yellow, I thought maybe it was touching the cold glass too much. I trimmed it back before this because it was very bushy in the middle and the underbrush leaves were choking each other. 

Now I have it in my living room about ~6-7 feet from a south-facing window with curtains, but there is a lamp sort of in the way? I don't know if it's getting too much light now or not enough since it was right up on the north window that had no curtain. 

I wait until my pothos are 1-2 in dry before watering and I live in a high desert climate (very dry). With the yellowing leaves, I've been really worried about root rot, so I've started watering after the soil has dried out more (like halfway or so, maybe more).

Please tell me what I'm doing wrong (light? watering?) and give suggestions on how to save her!!"

This happens, and your plant is gorgeous. It won’t miss a few shriveled leaves. If you start to notice it happening a lot, scale back on watering. These guys don’t let one or two leaves shrivel when they’re thirsty (instead all of the leaves will get wrinkly and soft, letting you know they need a drink), but it can happen if it’s slightly overwatered.

1) stop moving your plant. Plants don’t like to be moved from a high to low light environment and the reverse. They tailored their leaves to the environment they grow 
2) that yellow looks like nutrients deficiency. I would try to add some slow release fertilizer. You can report and add the fertilizer into the new potting soil or you can poke some holes with a tooth pick and place the fertilizer “grains” in to the little holes.

Only watered it twice in the month I've had it (so every 2 weeks) and both times it was droopy and needed it. Is it root bound or watering issue?","I did some research when I got the plant, and I knew that overwatering was the biggest killers of these plants, so I've only watered my pothos twice since I've gotten it, and only when it was drooping/sad-looking and the leaves were curling inward. I think I waited the right amount of time because the leaves perked back up both times. 

Earlier today, I saw the yellow and dying leaf that got me worried. When I got the plant, it had a few brown spots on it already, and I didn't think much of it. But now, I'm worried because even the new growth is browning. 

I've seen a lot of varying advice about what causes brown spots out there - from overwatering to sunburn to diseases - so I figured I should just ask myself with my own pictures.

I read that pothos like to get comfortable in their pot, and can stay in the same pot for a long time without needing to be repotted - even if it looks root bound; so it's really hard for me to judge if it's root bound and needs to be repotted as a newbie. I also looked for root rot but didn't see any brown or mushy roots right away.

Any advice would be appreciated. If it does need to be repotted, does it need a larger container? Should I clip away the dying leaf and brown edges? Do I need to change the watering schedule or maybe not use tap water? 

Thanks!"

Roots grown in soil typically rot when placed in water, so that’s expected. Anytime I have to move a plant from soil to water I’ll typically discard existing roots to make new cutting(s).

The cuttings still look healthy! You did the right thing being proactive with the rot. As long as you keep changing the water and removing any rotten pieces, the bacterial growth will lessen over time and you won’t need the peroxide.

You can always give the cuttings a thorough rinse when you change the water too, that will help keep the bacteria under control as well."

It doesn't look like you have very many, so use a q-tip soaked in isopropyl alcohol and wipe them off. Then I'd give the plant a good, careful wash, and spray it with a horticultural oil/neem oil to get rid of any possible eggs.

For whatever reason these guys gross me out more than other pests. Maybe because they remind me of ticks..."
80690,t3_gxbfn7,Roommates plant had bloomed a beautiful flower but today she said it’s dying. Is this due to overwatering?,It's a bromeliad which is an air plant so it needs very little water.  They also die after they flower but if you're lucky it'll sprout pups that grow in to new plants.
258393,t3_pkerg3,"The bottom row/4 leaves on my pilea are very droopy and starting to turn, what do I do? Is it watering or light?",It’s normal for older leaves to turn yellow and fall off. I would just pinch those ones off if I were you and keep doing what you’re doing bc your plant looks very happy! A little all purpose houseplant fertilizer could help too.
33311,t3_diws5m,What’s growing in my Boston fern pot? These don’t look like the new fronds but are kind of furry like them. Should I pull out/cut these?,these are rhizomes!! they're pretty much like aerial roots and a lot of fern type plants get these. in ferns they're mainly used to absorb moisture from the air! you definitely shouldn't pull them out! 🌱
294735,t3_seyjq6,Hi! I got this ZZ plant a few weeks ago from Home Depot. However now it seems like some of the stems and the one rhizome are darkening. Do you think there is root rot or am I just being crazy?,Honestly its a possibility given how big box stores tend to over water and those yellowing leaves could be indicative of that. But the only way to be sure if its actually rot is to feel it and look at all the roots. How much have you watered it since you got it?

258281,t3_pk7vir,What are those weird white spots von my Alocasia Polly leaves? I first thought it was dust but it’s part of the leaves! Is it harmful?,"When I've had spider mites it starts this way. No visible pests but light damage to the plant leaves. Then suddenly everything is infested. I'd recommend starting to rinse your plant and spraying down with insecticidal soap.

Can also possibly be mineral buildup from tap water, but that would be pretty extreme."
90990,t3_hi9i4x,"I bought this ZZ plant and upon reporting, found complete rot. I let the stalks dry out then put them in this pot with well draining soil. What now?

176519,t3_lgf77u,"What should Orchid roots be doing? Got this in a swap, seems healthy but hasn't flowered in a while. Does it need a bigger pot?","They usually bloom once a year in cooler temperaturesso usuallyin the fall/winter. If it was blooming when you got it it might not for another 2 years because they are often forced to bloom before fully mature in flower shops. As for the pot I don't know that I would repot yet. It depends on how the root system in the pot looks, is it and how old the medium is. At 1 to 2 years old it can become decomposed and toxic to the plant. A good resource is MissOrchidGirl on YouTube. She does a beginner series that covers everything from basics to the more advanced things."

I would prune the top of all of the stems. This would force new leaf growth beneath and make the stems thicker and eventually more woody looking. 
Water much less. About every 6 to 8 weeks.
Great pruning videos on You tube. Good luck."
192078,t3_m9hfg0,"Had my pothos for a year and she was THRIVING, but suddenly started turning yellow. I trimmed off the sad parts (a good third!) and repotted, and two weeks later she’s looking sick again. What’s happening??",I just fixed an older neglected pothos of mine in a similar situation. When I first repotted her she just looked sadder. I cut her long vines back and had two glasses full of cuttings. One glass I moved back into the pot as soon as the roots started showing up. The other glass I let the new roots grow a bit longer. I even had a few leaves I just stuck straight in the soil.  Now everyone is back in the pot and doing well. It might be an option if she doesn't perk up for you.
34435,t3_dn1xdm,My boss put me in charge of this plant and all I did was water once a week and leave by the window. Now it's randomly going yellow and some leaves have odd bumps and some stay curled up. How can I save it?,"It's a calathea Freddie also known as calathea concinna. Yellowing leaves are a sign of both over watering or underwatering. When leaves curl up it's either too hot or too cold or just thirsty.  Usually the problem lies with the roots. 

Calathea need medium to bright indirect light and well drained moist soil. Soggy soil leads to root rot. I would remove the pebbles and poke holes gently  in the soil with a long skewer or chopstick to aerate the soil. If the soil is too wet, you may have to change the soil. The plant also needs lots of humidity or else the leaves get crispy with brown edges. Calathea are sensitive to the minerals in  tap water and thrive best when watered with rain water or distilled water. They are are also susceptible to attacks by thrips, spider mites and other bugs. So I would check the leaves thoroughly. 

As you can see, these are very fussy plants.  Your boss should have given you the info on it's care. If you google or search you tube you will find lots of advice. Best of luck."
171953,t3_l7givx,Help! My fiddle fig is getting brown spots and losing leaves. The bottom is about to fall off. It’s also getting no new growth! What am I doing wrong here?,"Figs are a very sensitive plant. I’ve killed and also revived many lol. They need LOTS of indirect bright light. If you don’t have that I would recommend a grow light. (Cheap on Amazon). Make sure it’s not near a draft, they hate that. And if you wanna get really technical, they also like a little more of a humid environment, so if a small humidifier is doable I would get one! The brown on its leaves can mean two things: over watering, if the spots are a dark brown that’s usually what that is. Or under watering, if the spot is a light brown and becomes dry/crunchy. Once a week watering might help but it’s totally dependent on your plant. I would get a water moisture meter (Amazon has them) so you can accurately measure the water in the soil to know 100% when the plant needs water, bc I might be more than a week exactly. When the meter shows the soil is in the mid-low moisture range, I water completely (sometimes in the shower) till the water comes out of the bottom of the pot. That way you can also gently wipe down the leaves from dust/dirt allowing them to be more receptive to light. Once your plant is in a good spot LEAVE IT ALONE. Don’t move it, they are total creatures of habit lol. Once it’s settled and in its growing season you should start to see new babies bud from the top of the plant in little brown cocoons. Hope this helped!"

139309,t3_jgg3ii,Hey! My bamboo isn’t doing too well. Its potted in just gravel and water. Should I cut the yellow part off or leave it? Like will it just stay yellow or repair itself over time?,"Others may know different, but as far as I know, yellow lucky bamboo is dead. I would seperate the piece that is yellowed into it's own pot, clean everything including all roots, and snip the yellowed part off at the highest node that has no yellowing. Check for slime on the plants or soft spots on the stems, make sure you don't have spider mites or anything similar.

Lucky bamboo can die from:

\- Insects- Too much sun- Not enough sun- Old water- Overly treated water- Too much fertiliser (they really don't need much)- Water that is too cold.

Since it's the top of the plant, I'd be inclined to think either insects, sun damage or some other kind of physical damage. Could you have maybe exposed it to too much sun while it was being trained? Or tied some wire around it too tightly? It's a shame - those helixes take a long time to grow!

Edit - Also, as you probably know, once you cut LB, the grow from the cut is stopped for good."

The gnats are attracted to the wet soil and they also like decaying things.

If new growth continues becoming trapped like this despite many cut backs, wait for full moon and 0km winds:
(1) Forfeit your soul in prayer before moon-set.
(2) Confess binding servitude to the plant and it's purposes.
(3) Create a ""bootable"" ISO of your brain using a carved ""portion"" of brainstem, USB, jumper and microwave according to this* guide. (expired)
(4) Embed brainstem-usb device into graft union anywhere on plant
(5) Douse plant in mineral turpentine + shamanic drum dance until oobe into permanent vegetable form.

Those are probably fungus gnats which live in soil that is too moist. That, along with the mushrooms growing in it mean that it has been very much overwatered or the soil does not have enough drainage. Does the pot have a drainage hole?

This guy should be repotted with all new soil. You will need to make sure all of the top soil is replaced to eliminate the fungus gnats. New, dry soil will also help pull away some of the moisture from the roots to hopefully prevent root rot. 

Take care with your watering after that. Nerve plants do like a moist soil, but still the top 1 inch or so of the soil should be completely dry before watering."

You might want to consider transferring to a well drained, more shallow pot. Additionally, succulents tend to grow rather tall when there’s a lack of sunlight. Consider giving it more direct light to keep its proportions more balanced.

You may want to consider trimming the plant (and then use the trimmings to propagate new plants if you want!). I would probably trim it and move it to a more shallow pot while ensuring it gets a good amount of sunlight."

127925,t3_iwgb5s,Some of my philodendron micans leaves have these thin spots (mostly only visible when light is shining through them) and I can’t figure out why. I’ve examined it with a flashlight and shaken the leaves over white paper to look for mites—nothing! What could be wrong?,"For your picture with the big, windowpane-esque blotch on a leaf, I've had that happen on other plants when they were getting too much light.

Then fill a huge bowl, or your sink, with water-about 4 inches deep.  Then place him in the water bath for a few hours or even overnight. He needs bottom watered after being dehydrated this long. After bottom watering you're bound to get some yellow leaves, but just cut them off. Then presto- new plant. 
He's a pothos. And a very resilient and forgiving plant. If you follow these instructions you'll get a happy plant, I promise.  He just looks like he hasn't been watered in a very long time. I water mine about once a week, and he does not like sun."

131849,t3_j371gz,I adopted this Philodendron and a week later the edges of some leaves have turned yellow! What's going on and how can I help?,"The leaf with yellowing edges could have a fungal infection or be struggling with humidity changes. [Fungal infection &amp; comparison pics here](https://imgur.com/a/dbQPl5y) thanks to [@snippiwippi](https://www.instagram.com/snippiwippi/) on instagram.

If it is a fungal infection, make sure to wear gloves or wash your hands thoroughly between handling an infected leaf and a healthy leaf. Some types of infections can be spread by skin to plant contact.

Alternatively, yellowing leaves often indicate issues with the roots or a problem with the watering schedule. When the roots become compromised, the intact of water is inhibited, thus the leaves start to turn yellow, typically from the edges.
When watering is too little or inconsistent, a plant will drop leaves to conserve energy and water so they can stay alive."
171425,t3_l67vv4,i was told that my lemon sapling was too low in its soil and the pot was too big so i just transfered him into this smaller one. is this better?,"Typically the pot size is based off of the root mass size. There are 2 important things to consider, one is larger the pot the faster and larger it will grow. So if this will end up outdoor no big deal but if you want this to stay inside you need a pot slightly larger than the current root mass or the plant will stretch. The other is if there are no roots to absorb the water you have to wait for it to evaporate or else you can cause rot from the soil being to moist constantly. The top may dry in a couple days but an inch down my stay wet until you water again and never dry out."
275892,t3_qr2g3w,my pilea is not looking good.. Is the stem bown because it's rotting? The leaves are pretty droopy and flimsy. Should I try to cut the stem and propagate?,"It looks in good health. I have one similar to yours and the stem is brown as well. I think this is lignification, where plants become woody. 

What do you mean by flimsy and weak? Do the leaves/stems come off? 

How are the roots? Can you take it out of the pot to assess them?"
291491,t3_s61q46,I peeled the dead layers off the top of my new Amaryllis Sumatra bulb and a few days later it has turned slightly red. Is this anything to worry about?,"Most likely those layers added some protection and now that the bulb is exposed it’s reacting. The dead skin doesn’t hurt anything, it would have been fine to leave it on there. In any case it’s probably not a major problem."
252240,t3_p8wile,How to save the peace lily? Pet got destroyed half of it. The front half is untouched. Can it be saved and grow back to what it was?,"Should be okay, peace lilys are usually quite resilient. 
I would slowly cut down the stems that the leaves were chewed off. Use clean shears and cut down to the base of where the stems split out of the crown to allow for new growth. I say slowly because you won't want to cut off more than 25% of the damaged stems at a time to not stress the plant more than it already is. You may even want to wait a week to start this process. With time, the plant will grow new stems.

Honestly, I might be more concerned for your pet. Lilies are toxic to animals and can cause renal failure. Maybe contact your vet to be safe?
Best wishes to all!"
279590,t3_r2x4di,What are these? Was repotting my Amazonian elephant ear and these were on its roots. The came off but some were still attached. What are they?,"Those are corms (yes corms, not corns). You can make new plants with those given that the corms are still firm and not mushy :) 

Plant them in a well draining pot with the little root part down (the top is where the plant grows up from). Don't let the soil dry out and by spring you're gonna start seeing new growth given you've taken good care of them. 

(This is also what many Alocasia's turn into if they get a hard dormancy where they lose all their leaves and die back. You're gonna be taking care of an empty pot until spring :P)"

42024,t3_eig3as,"Is this plant overwatered or under watered right now? It was watered six days ago. Also, do the aerial roots imply it needs a larger pot now?","Aerial roots are not necessarily an indicator of anything. Once you've repotted a few times and are familiar with its root system you'll probably be able to eyeball it; in the meantime, you can check by feeling down into the soil from the top and up into the soil from the bottom (through the drainage hole). If you can feel substantial roots, it's time to pot up. There are other telltale signs that will vary by plant, but that's a decent rule of thumb across pretty much all plants.

And I know it's not what you asked but while I'm on the subject: there is no such thing as a plant that likes to be rootbound. There are plants that do things *we* like when they are rootbound, and there are plants that would rather be rootbound than, say, being overwatered, but if we're talking about the health of the plant,  ideal care conditions will never include being rootbound.

Ok, packing up my soapbox now, carry on everyone."

Put a stick deep in the pot and wrap a hair tie around it, Don’t pull it super tight. Just go until the leaf starts to lean, don’t make it.

It is located in front of my window (facing NE)... but it’s still dying... what else can I do?,"Start by pulling off all the dead stems and see what you have left. If there’s no rot left and a few leaves, it should bounce back as long as it’s not overwatered or sunburned. They like bright but only indirect light and for the soil to be moist (barely, compared to my other plants). 

If the rot/burn is down to the centre of the plant then you might want to try to propagate some of the healthy leaves instead.

Edit: also check out r/africanviolets for care tips :)"
41093,t3_ee66ds,I gave my plant plant feed and ever since it's leaves are falling off and it looks like it's dying. How do I rescue it?,"Is it winter where you are? Generally it’s not a good idea to fertilize in the winter. If it is reacting to being over fertilized, hopefully it will settle down over time as the fertilizer is absorbed and flushed out by regular watering.

I see there is a heat radiator right next to the plant, that could also be the issue."
184125,t3_lujc9k,My monstera keeps on getting these spots and I’ve paid attention to watering and the amount of sun. What could be the problem?,If it is fungal or root rot you can revitalize the roots using a 1:1 hydrogen peroxide mix with water. It will kill the fungus and aerate the soil and roots. This has helped me so much with my struggling plants. I have a monstera that wasn’t doing anything for over a year and I started treating it with h2o2 and it’s finally putting out 2 new leaves with so many fenestrations and holes!

I live in a dry climate so I throw on the humidifier a couple times a month. Will this hurt the plant?","This is a really good thing, and you shouldn’t change the soil. 

Basically for fungi to make mushrooms (fruiting bodies), the mycelium (sorta like fungi roots) has to have fully spread throughout whatever substrate it’s in. This fully spread mycelium prevents other fungi(including harmful ones) from infiltrating. Mold and root rotting are both caused by harmful fungi, which are now not as much concerns for this plant!

341165,t3_w63dbq,My Calathea is sweating sticky droplets under her leaves! Is this an infection or from some type of micro bug?,"So some pests can produce this kind of sap, but I think calatheas also just do this on their own-- at least mine seem to.  

I think it's somewhere between expelling excess water and producing extra floral nectaries, like philodendron tend to have. The sticky sap is sweet and meant to attract ants, which then thwart off certain pests actually harmful to the plant.

Hard to tell if there's any pests from these pics. I can maybeee see some spider mites on the underside of the leaf in the first pic, but it might also just be small sap droplets reflecting... when you look closely (like really closely), do you see any clusters of tiny white bugs? I don't think spider mites would cause the sap, but maybe the plant could produce it as a stress response to them? Also a strong sign of mites if you see any thick webbing, too"

I didn’t soak it but the leaves were a little curled so I assumed it needed water.. Any ideas?,These are so finicky. When I first got mine from my florist friend it was medium sized and potted in a nice pot with drainage etc. she just didn’t want it anymore. I moved it to my house and put it on my shelf next to a nw facing window and within a day or two it was drooping. I watered it and then in a week it was dead. I propped three of the remaining leaves. They didn’t have stems so I just put them halfway in a cup of water and they rooted just fine and eventually grew some baby leaves. Replanted them and now I have a much smaller but successful peperomia! They do tend to lean quite a bit towards sunlight. I put mine in cactus soil and I think that did the trick because it was never happy before when I watered it or didn’t water it. Hope that helps

Both fungus and pests can spread from plant to plant. Keep this guy quarantined. Do the black spots feel like bumps/ have a shell texture and don't move? If so, it could be scale."

What's going on?,"The way that mushy bottom leaf looks makes me think of root rot/overwatering. How often are you watering, and is there drainage in the container? And did you change the soil after purchase? Echeveria drop very shriveled leaves when they're under a lot of sun/aren't getting enough water. Would not recommend misting, you might take the farina off the plant, which helps it from getting sunburned.

Side note, the split rock should probably get its own pot, it has different water and soil requirements than the rest of the plants in the arrangement."

295099,t3_sfwq7g,"Was watering my plants and thought I’d check the drainage holes, what is this?? I’m obviously repotting it ASAP but???","Mold means you’re overwatering. It doesn’t have to mean too much water at one time, you could also be watering too frequently, or have the plant in a pot that’s too big, meaning there are areas the roots don’t reach where the water stays in the soil too long. I believe thats a kind a succulent so it should prefer infrequent, deep waterings. It won’t tolerate living in a pot larger than it’s root system because lingering water in the soil is harmful for the roots."
39908,t3_e97tqo,Q about Neem oil... I’ve used a neem spray to temporarily deal with a hardcore fungal infection while waiting for hydrogen peroxide to arrive to kill it. After spraying the fungal spots seem to be getting worse - is that normal?!?,"I’m not seeing fungal spots. Can you point out where it is?

The tip of that front leaf could be damaged from drought, heat, or some other stress. If that is what you are targeting, the best way is to sterilize snips or scissors with 10 % bleach and then cut off the dead tissue. No need to spray unless it spread to multiple leaves

Neem oil is rather harsh (all oils stress out plants by clogging the stomata) and begonia is a very sensitive plant. I’m not surprised that it would have some phytotoxicity.

Source: plant health specialist

Edit: I see the small spots now. (Should have turned up my screen brightness, lol.) I would sooner treat that by trimming the worst of the leaves, and making sure there is good airflow around the plant. Like I said, neem is can be very harsh on some species."

I've used soapy water and that has worked on contact BUT THEY KEEP COMING BACK, WHAT SHOULD I DO ?","Since catnip is pretty easy to grow from seed or propagate, I'd consider starting over if they're this bad. Either by taking cutting and submerging the cuttings in water long enough to kill the bugs, then water propagating the cuttings, or if you have seeds, starting again. Catnip attracts pests, and I've definitely composted a few catnip plants to start over due to this. Make sure to toss out the soil."

How can I do that with plants that want to be moist all the time?","I found using a light layer of diatomaceous earth on all my plants got rid of them all completely. It doesn’t have a nasty smell either. Diatomaceous earth is made up of tiny fossilized diatoms (plankton) that have accumulated over millennia in fresh water lakes. So its organic and safe for you and if you have pets. From what I understand it just causes cuts on the insects that kills them.  However it does it, I used it a year ago and have had no pests since.

How can I help?","This is an angel wing begonia. They are fairly fussy, and quite fragile, but once you get the hang of it, they’re incredible!

They like moderately low light (no direct sun) and high humidity, with rich soil high in nitrogen (because they’re typically grown just for their leaves).  Even thought they like high humidity, their leaves are sensitive and don’t typically respond well to misting. They don’t like drafts at all, so they perform well when they are placed in a terrarium (or under a cloche) which allows them to be protected from drafts and have high humidity.  Allow the soil to be always damp, but never wet, and never dry. (Easier said than done!)

The good news is that under the right conditions, they’re very robust: you can very often propagate the leaves in water, and they respond well to pruning by putting out new leaves, allowing you to easily propagate new plants while keeping the parent plant attractive and healthy. (Just don’t prune this one quite yet - give it time to adjust to an improved care routine.)

Good luck, Keep us updated!"

What could be happening?,I know you said you’ve check for bugs but what you are describing is a HUGE sign of scale. They look like little brown bumps and tend to congregate on the branches where leaves attach and the underside of leaves. If your floor is getting that sticky it sounds like a huge infestation. Neem oil treatments and honestly outing an internal pesticide would be your best option; kill them from the inside and the outside.

I also see that it is a little wet towards the center? When you water it, make sure that you are absolutely soaking all of the soil until water is flowing from the drainage hole. That ensures that water is reaching all of the roots. Overwatering = frequency of watering ≠ amount of water. Good luck!"

105635,t3_hzqpir,Help! My biggest and most favorite plant has had a resurgence in thrips and nothing is working. It's getting worse and spreading to my other plants. What should I do?,"Some backstory: I got this guy from a nursery while visiting my parents in Florida. He had thrips then, but I successfully treated him with neem and systemic before I brought him back to my home. Everything was great for two months, and then the thrips came back. Hard. The systemic must've worn off and I didn't realize I'd need to do it again as a preventative. 

So I took him out, sprayed him with a hole bottle of Captain Jack's Deadbug with Spinosad, and gave him a hefty dose of systemic that should've kicked in in two weeks. Also, hauling this guy anywhere is a feat and a chore because he's massive and freaking heavy. I can't keep spraying him down regularly, and I'm sure the movement is spreading the thrips around the house. 

Well a couple weeks passed, and no improvement. I treated with systemic again. I took him out and Q-tipped with hydrogen peroxide every little bug I could find multiple times. Every time they came back with a vengeance the next day.

I'm at my wits end. Now my other prized plants are developing thrip damage and the occasional thrip itself. 

I'm thinking about buying beneficial insects, however I've already used systemic and I don't know if that will kill them. I also don't know which beneficial insect would be best, or if they'd even work, because they're not exactly cheap. Does anyone have any experience with them? 

This guy is just too big for me to properly treat so I need to resort to ecological warfare if that's the answer."

The dead leaves are probably just the die off from growing new ones. It looks like you have at least 3 separate plants in there

Currently residing in our bathroom by the shower. I water once a week. What do you think is wrong?","I can help you. These guys are my specialty. Basically, the soil needs to be fully dry prior to watering. Water thoroughly, until it runs out of the drainage holes.  Spider plants must have bright light, INCLUDING direct light. Offset production and foliage shape are both directly related to light exposure. [Source](https://mrec.ifas.ufl.edu/foliage/folnotes/spider.htm).

This looks like the right type of flower for this sort of plant, and they can feel papery, maybe appear fake on inspection.

If they're really fake, they're presumably on spikes. You can pull them out and the wounds should dry up over time.  Otherwise the plant looks fairly healthy. One day you'll get an beautiful ring of flowers that look sort of like these fake ones.

If the soil is dry to the touch I’d say it’s time to water again.

Droopy leaves can by caused by too little water. When the soil surface is dry to the touch, water your plant well, water again when the soil surface becomes dry.

Any advice?,"I have 11 flf’s that are doing well. Over watering is almost always the case. They are challenging, but you’ll get the hang of it. Use a pair of clean shears to cut off the damaged leaves. Cut them off at the base of the leaf’s stem. Take the plant out of the planter. Look at the roots. If any are brown and mushy gently cut those off. Replant in fresh soil with some perlite mixed in. Water it, place it by a window with indirect light, not next to a vent and let it rest for two weeks. After two weeks, stick your finger in the soil. Water it when the top two inches are dry, should be dry to the second knuckle of your finger. When watering, use a 3-1-2 plant nutrient mixed in with your water. I personally like CNS17 grow but any 3-1-2 will work. These plants hate drastic change, so once you’ve chosen a good spot for them try not to change their location. It’s okay to rotate them every few weeks to capture light all over the plant, but don’t change spots entirely if possible. Remember to not over water. Good luck!"

I’m a nana who’s grown houseplants for 40 years, so imma do my nana thing and tell you what else you can do to get her healthy if this doesn’t work. It’s my nana gene working overtime. Repot into good quality potting soil and be sure to remove the old soil and untangle roots if needed.  Fill your new pot about a quarter to half full depending on the length of the roots. To help with repotting awkwardness, grip your plant stem right above her soil line, kinda suspended in midair over the new pot with roots dangling, and add soil up to the previous level. It’s difficult to do but just laugh at yourself during this process or ‘phone a friend’. Water GENTLY but thoroughly so all roots will contact the soil. Place in bright light and turn the pot weekly to expose all leaves to light. Water when top 2” of soil is dry which about to your second knuckle, and fertilize every other watering by mixing a liquid fertilizer into the water.

The plants have been growing nicely, they've been gaining height since the start of this year spring, but on the past months I've noticed that the newer roots simply stop sticking to the wall, they start not by the tip, but by about at the 3 ft height mark, then they slowly detach themselves from the wall.

I've been trying using plant tape, and while it has worked for a bit, I'm worried that this will keep happening, since my idea is to fill up the wall, I dont want that in the future the whole plant wall just collapses down, any ideas on why this is happening? and what can I do to correct it?

In time of stress, ""hybernation"", or senences (no idea how to spell that) the plant will withdraw mobile nutrients and water from the furthest most extremities (this is why nitrogen defeciencies are first shown at the tips of leaves just like plants wilting from no water also start at the leaves) the removed water and mobile nutrients are then stored in any storage organs for future use. Allowing some plants to miraculously recover from almost certain death once an environmental trigger occurs ( like a particularly heavy morning dew). It is also quite possible that your fern has asexually (through rhizomes) created a new plant that has lower nutrient and water requirements than the ""mother"" which can henceforth survive in a tougher environment. It is also possible your plant sexually reproduced and dropped spores, which can be stored in unideal circumstances untill circumstances change for the positive, see (heavy morning dew)."

[In the wild](https://www.google.com/search?q=snake+plant+wild&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM-KGGpKjZAhVhwYMKHWphA8IQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=631) snake plants spread out, horizontally, and support each other to reach, upright.

Restricting the base of the plant to a small pot forces the leaves outward and downward. Take a handful of straws and squeeze the base to see what I mean.

I would try a larger, rectangular pot to mimic the natural growing conditions. Good drainage, is also critical."

that’s a huge pot for the size of the plant, so even if you water the same as you did before the split, the roots can’t absorb as much water as the pot holds so it causes it to stay wet too long. I’d recommend watering a lot less, or putting the plant in a smaller pot until it gets bigger"

31383,t3_dc2vh2,Hi friends. This is my calla lily. I recently had little gnats crawling all over it. I repotted it and thought I got rid of them but they’re back. Does anyone have any suggestions?,"Fungus gnats maybe? They can come from potting soil and if you have them they are can be annoying to get rid of. I got some from some soil and to get rid of them I got some yellow sticky traps that I put around my plants and then I watered them with a hydrogen peroxide solution (4 parts water to 1 part hydrogen peroxide - the stuff they sell at drug stores that’s like 3%)

The gnats can lay a bunch of eggs so the hydrogen peroxide solution kills the eggs and the sticky traps take care of the gnats. It takes awhile but it will get them eventually. 

Gnats like damp soil so if your soil is consistently damp (either because it doesn’t drain fast enough or because you have a lot of tropical plants that like moist soil) you may have this crop up again. I try to water once a month or so with the hydrogen peroxide solution as a preventative. 

I’ve also heard that sprinkling the top of your soil with diatomaceous earth can help as well although I haven’t tried that since what I am doing is currently working for me. 

Good luck getting rid of them!"

8193,t3_bctbuv,My hoya rope got two yellow leaves and getting soft. I watered it once when i got it 3 weeks ago and the soil is still wet. Should I just changed out the soil?,"Yes.  Change the soil and check to make sure your pot is draining freely.  If it’s in something without drainage holes, buy a new pot with a saucer.  

When you change out the soil, mix in some perlite- it keeps soil light and helps prevent root rot.  Also check the roots for rot...rot will look like brown mushy...cut those parts off and throw them out.  

Only water when the top two inches of soil are dry (stick your finger in to the first or second knuckle to check).  Let water flow freely out the holes in the bottom, and dump out any water in the saucer.  

Yellowing leaves is often a sign of over watering...so if you notice that on plants...be mindful about checking them before watering.  Also, you can cut off anything yellow- it won’t come back. 

Good luck."

Could you delicately remove the plant from its pot and check the roots? Try to remove a much soil as you can by washing the roots.
If you have rootrot, anything mushy brown needs to be pruned (disinfect your shears before and after).
Then repot in well draining soil (the soil they come in usually retains too much water) and check that the pot has drainage.
The potting mix I use is a mix of potting mix for houseplant that I mix with seramis (no perlite where I live but you can use that as well) and a handful of gravel.
Put the plant in a less lit corner and don't water immediately so that it can recover.

172671,t3_l8w9xd,"I've somehow managed to keep this orchid blooming but the ""spike"" is out of control. What do I do to fix this?","Just curious...how long have you had this orchid?

The spikes....just below the flowering part of the spike, you have a new secondary spike of blossoms happening. After the end-point blossoms drop off, you can trim that spike to an inch after the secondary blossom spike. Wipe down some scissors with 70% isopropyl alcohol and then make the cut. Dab a teeny bit of cinnamon powder on the cut surface. It will help the cut callous over and minimize possible infection.

The other two spikes, I would go ahead and trim them down near the base.  Again, clean your scissors and dab with cinnamon. One looks like something is trying to happen but based on the fact you only have two leaves and one looks like it's on the way out, cutting off the two non-blossom spikes might help the plant overall. 

One of the leaves looks like it is in the process of either being severely dehydrated or over watered or it's aging out. You might be losing it before too long. 

If you recently received this orchid....you might want to consider repotting into more traditional phalenopasis potting mix. You can get this at most big box stores or a garden center.

This has nothing to do with the spikes, but please....do not use ice cubes for watering.  Use room temperature water...like Mom- nature would use.

What could I do for my plants to thrive??,"First of all, repot with a fast draining mix- I'd recommend equal parts cactus soil and perlite. Once a week is too often to water most succulents, try watering them thoroughly about every three weeks instead. It looks like you have elephant bush (upper left corner) and that will be a good indicator of when to water- its leaves wrinkle when it gets thirsty so hold off on watering until you see that happen."

I don’t let my aloes dry out, as long as they have proper drainage. I’ve found mine thrive getting watered about weekly, especially since they’re in a location with lots of sun. If you’re concerned about root rot with a lot of watering, you can occasionally use a bit of diluted hydrogen peroxide."

What do you think?,"old leaves just die sometimes, as long as it's putting out new ones, it's probably fine, it's just re-absorbing them and putting more energy into bigger more efficient leaves"
310337,t3_tt168d,My in laws gave me this orchid and said I could try to revive it. Do I even bother or should I just provide hospice care until the end?,"Yes, totally retrievable. I rehab these all the time.

Firstly you will want to cut the flower spike off. 

Secondly, it looks very dehydrated, so take it out of the medium and inspect the roots. Cut off any roots which are papery (these are dead), and any roots which are desiccated (shrivelled and hard). Keep any roots that are silvery and turn green under water. If you are left with no roots then it is still able to be saved, don't panic. 

Now you'll want to go and search YouTube for Miss Orchid Girl and watch any of her techniques for rehabilitating phalaenopsis orchids. She's the best. Also watch her basic care videos if you have never kept an orchid before. 

The most important things to remember about orchid care are: 

You should not use ice cubes to water it. No matter what anyone says to you. It's a tropical plant.

Do not water from above. If water is left to sit in the crown then it will rot. Always leave the pot to soak in water. 

Phals are epiphytes. They do not grow in soil. Only ever plant them in bark or other airy medium like leca. 

When the flower dies the plant is still alive. Don't chuck it out. Nobody chucks out their rose bush when it stops flowering.

When you've got no roots, the plant can still bounce back. When you've got no leaves the likelihood of it bouncing back is slim. When the crown is rotted it's dead. 

Good luck!"

Online sources said it could be root rot, so I haven’t watered it since I got it, just misting. How do I rescue mission my new baby?","That soil looks pretty dense. I second the recommendation to unpot and check the roots. The ficus might also appreciate being repotted into a better-draining soil (aim for like 1/3 to 1/2 perlite to the rest a good indoor potting mix).

I'd also stop misting it. Misting does not actually increase ambient humidity levels and promotes disease--especially fungal. Are the leaves floppy or spongy feeling?"

I think you could even repot with the stem deeper in the soil, but I'm not 100% sure for this one as I only own the smaller / creeping kinds of tradescantias, this one is apparently rhizomatous so it's a bit different. I think it looks cool personally, but I get how it's annoying and takes extra space, my pilea is growing exactly like that and I should probably hang it ~~months ago~~ someday."

I have mine sitting beside my sink beside a south facing window so it gets a lot of bright and sometimes direct light. I water it with filtered water (basically I pour any left over night time water into a watering can and go from there)... however, I'm pretty stingy on watering since the pot it comes in doesn't have a hole. I'm Team-Hole and I really like to see the water come out and evaporate. I understand the other side, but ensuring that the water in the bottom of the hole-less pot isn't high and doesn't sit there causing root rot is not my style. I also give mine kelp fertilizer. It's seems to be very happy with that sort of care and has lots of lush green leaves.

So... what is the watering schedule of the plant? Does it sit in water for days? What about light? What sort of light does it get? (Please don't suddenly put it in direct light, plants can get sunburned just like people can. You need to do it gradually.)"

Go to r/lithops , they're more at experts than plantclinic page itself when comes to mesembs.


First thing, I see roots are outside , the rocks are too big sharp, the white yellow ish dry spots are scars,  nothing too much worry. 

Other thing it's winter season for them so no strictly water due to splitting time. They are taking old nutrients to make new body.

Another common problem on pepper that causes misshapen leaves is broad mites. If this were the case, you'd see the growing point(s) of the the plant showing the most severe symptoms. You usually can't see the mites themselves.

Thrips can also cause misshapen leaves, but you'll usually see a ton of thrips on the plant if the damage is this bad."

Several in there look like aloe and haworthiopsis, which both prefer less water than most succulents.

I also notice that your soil mix looks like regular potting soil (except that one in the front that just looks like topsoil). Mixing in some perlite or pumice and sand will improve drainage and help to prevent overwatering.

1119,t3_7m3w6o,Got this unknown plant from my mom and he doesn’t look great - what’s the best thing I can do for him?,"It looks rotted at the base. Ponytail palms love to be root locked in small pots, so repotting in a larger pot won't help you. Looks like over watering. Theyre actually considered part of the succulent family so require well draining soil, full soaking with the ability to dry out between waterings and a fair amount of light. I water mine once a week, and the one that i have more in indirect light i just monitor the soil moisture making sure it dries out before i water it again. I would try a deeper pot next time, the diameter looks appropriate for the base size of your plant, and line the bottom with gravel and activated charcoal if you dont have a pot with a drainage hole. Cactus soil is a must. "

Any advice?","i always wait until the leaves tell me they need water lol. normally my pilea leaves feel plump when they are happy, but when they want to be watered their leaves have more flexibility to them. that’s a great indication to start watering. waiting like this also prevents overwatering because you are only watering it when the plant is actually telling u it wants water. i normally water it once every 2 weeks. in my experience overwatering and being root bound can cause yellowing leaves. overwatering is certainly the most common though. you can also try changing up the soil mixture by adding more perlite so the soil doesn’t hold as my water for long periods of time"

214861,t3_ndwv1b,all my plants have fungus gnats in them and I have diatomaceous earth powder and hydrogen peroxide. should I use both methods and leave my plants outside for a little?,"Unpopular plant opinion, hydrogen peroxide is overrated. I've never actually seen evidence that it kills fungus gnat larvae, it just seems to be one of those things that's suggested a lot.  You can use DE, it's kind of messy and if you top water you'd probably have to re-apply. Bottom watering can help keep the top soil drier so it's less appealing to gnats. You can also use a thick layer of perlite/sand as a mulch, which is not always going to be practical either. I like to be able to put my fingers in the soil to see if the plant needs water.

I highly suggest using mosquito dunks/bits, or another product with bacillus israeliensis. This is a biological control that kills larvae when they eat it. Unfortunately it doesn't last long in the soil so you have to keep using it until you're confident they're gone. You can keep it soaking in a watering can to water with. Follow the instructions on the package for when to replace the product in your can. It can take a few weeks to work, as some gnats will have reached the pupae stage already, at which point the dunks don't work. I suggest combining this with yellow sticky traps to cut down the adult numbers.

If you can leave the plants outside at the same time it will probably help in drying the soil and giving the adult gnats less of a target with all the other dirt around."

As for repot … they like to be root bound. Wait until it’s dry and lift it out to get us a pic of the roots to see

*edit. Forgot about the mushrooms. They’ve appeared because there’s decaying material in the soil. Not necessarily bad as far as I’m aware  someone else can confirm if it’s a sign of issues but I think they are fine to leave or just pluck out.

I would remove the dead parts and trim nicely from the top to check if it's alive (probably is as I can see on photo). Leave the healthy part on a bright place, not too cold or warm for some dormancy. It should recover slowly soon.

I don’t bother it until it starts to droop and look thirsty. 

Alternately, Is it still in the soil it came in? Often they are sold packed in 100% peat which can harden into a water resistant knot in the center of the pot. When you top water, the water goes around the hydrophobic part. And just wets the top and sides. You can avoid that by soaking the pot in a sink full of water for 15-30m and watching for air bubbles. Poke a chop stick into the center. If a stream of air bubbles follows, it’s gotten hydrophobic.  I’d highly recommend repotting it with proper potting soil with a bit of extra perlite added to increase drainage and prevent that hardened center. It’s still a manageable size now but you don’t want to have to be pulling it up to soak it when it gets long and trailing."

Is she doomed?","Anything dried up will have to be cut away unfortunately. But they grow back fast! I mist mine 2x a day and water about every three days. 

Give a generous hack job and water when the soil starts feeling dry. Don’t let the soil dry out (but also make sure there is appropriate drainage and it doesn’t sit in water).

Good luck! You’ll get the hang of it and this baby will make a roaring comeback.

I got this hibiscus at the beginning of summer, and we just brought her inside cuz temperatures where I am are a trying to drop. why are hee leaves turning yellow? too much or too little water?","Just the transition from outdoor to indoor conditions can trigger some leaf yellowing and drop, especially older leaves that may have been close to aging out anyway.  Unless it becomes much more extensive I don't think you have a problem."
11208,t3_bo4cs4,"Been trying to recover my plants from the winter and struggling, advice on how to get them to flourish again?","I've had this plant for about a year or so now (july/aug 2018) and so somewhat new at taking care of succulents, they were chilling at my window sill and looked green and had thick leaves but then canadian winter hit and I didn't want them to freeze. Moved them to my desk with a UV growth light I quickly got from amazon (doesn't have a timer so its manual). 

&amp;#x200B;

After winter had passed, moved them back to the window sill in March where we were getting sun. I found that I've been over watering them and switched to cactus soil to see if they would improve, some of them took it well, the others not so much? I water them once a week on mondays, they do have a drain hole so I'm careful with that now. My left succulent received a bad sunburn after a day, so I moved him back to UV light spot to recover his green so he looks alot better now. The right succulent has been curling ever since, I did read that it needed alot of light so he's growing again but he just looks sad... One of his leaves fell off and is propagating, so i'll be moving that onto another dish. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love some advice on how to recover them back to how they were, I did order a new UV lamp with a timer now since weekends I'm gone for more than 12hr due to work."
10971,t3_bnepva,"I got this marble queen pothos on Thursday, I potted it and watered it and then left on a trip. I got home today (Saturday) and it looks like this. It looks like it needs water, but I just watered it two days ago. The soil is a little bit moist but not really moist. What should I do?",Not a pothos expert but imo best to leave it for another couple of days. You'd kill it quicker by overwatering than not enough water and it's probably just adjusting to its new home

193607,t3_mcqo7w,Why the tips are dying? How can I revive this plant (the name I don't even try to remember anymore). It's almost summer here and I was told to keep the pot in a shade with indirect sunlight. What am I doing wrong?,I believe this is a wandering dude! Or a Tradescantia zebrina. Does the plant get much humidity? What's your watering like?
68727,t3_ge103u,My newly repotted succulent pup has these black spots under some of its leaves. Does anyone know what they are?,It could be rot. Are the leaves also squishy or falling apart easily?
127478,t3_ivodhs,I have 2 types of pothos in the same pot and one of them has these brown spots on almost every leaf. What could be the problem?,"The brown spots are on the white variegated areas. That’s quite normal for white areas to turn brown despite you doing everything right. Pothos like to dry out, so maybe wait a little longer between waterings :)"
10633,t3_bmi7ya,My otherwise happy Calathea has a few brown edges. I have it on a tray of pebbles and next to a humidifier grouped with other tropical plants. The pot has no drainage hole but has lava rocks on the bottom. Could it be the pot is too big for the plant? It’s possible I overfertilized. What now?,"I'm having the same issue. I've read that brown edges can be caused by tap water. You can use filtered water or let water sit for 24hrs before watering. I'm in the process of trying this out myself.

10477,t3_blz45v,"Tomato leaves are dry/papery/brittle, and plants are splitting at the sucker joints. Is this a watering issue?",Maybe. Tomatoes aren't very strong and the branches do tend to break if it's windy or they get dry/wet/dry or full of ripe fruit. Is this an heirloom or open pollinated variety? Brown rings around stems and especially brown rings in the xylem layer are concerning for the major fungal wilts.
72534,t3_gkscd2,"Hey guys, can someone please tell me what is wrong with my cactus and what can I do to make it better?",I think it's all about the sunlight. Because it just directs itself to light. You should try to change the position where it can easily utilize the sunlight.

I repotted it and it is now in front if a north facing window as to not shock it. Should I move it to a south window? What should I do with this rotting stem? Any other advice?,"Jade plants need high light, so I would definitely move it to a south-facing window at some point, but it may need to be slowly acclimated to avoid stress. Personally, I would remove the rotted stem, on the off chance the rot spreads."
127093,t3_iuyqdm,Help!! can i save this beautiful baby. My boyfriend got me this palm and i think he has a disease. Can he be salvaged?,My palms have these black spots too and I don’t think they’re a disease? Because I’ve seen this on many palms and all healthy ones.
229453,t3_o4z8ro,"How can I improve the health of my Monstera? The leaves are turning black/yellow, even the new ones growing. Is it rotting?","There is a lot going on here! I would say that you need to remove any of the leaves that have been damage or are dying no use to the plant. If you just got your plant it’s most likely in shock and will take time to acclimate especially if you bought it online it’s been through a lot ! Also, don’t trust moisture meters stick your finger in the soil monsteras love to have moist soil and realistically there’s no better way than to use a finger. Also, bottom water it’s the way i stopped killing all of my plants they take what they need and go on their merry way. 

Overall don’t panic just know you may lose a bit before you get a handle on it - takes time but it should continue to grow and be happy in time

Edit: But also are those roots coming out of the bottom of the pot ?"
71426,t3_gizl1m,I just read that a brown succulent stem means it has rot and it will likely die. Is that true or is it okay if it looks like this?,"I think they mean like dark, mushy brown. Almost black. Stems that look woody are part of the maturing plant process."
145541,t3_jrgdpq,Every time my elephant ear grows a new leaf another one dies. I thought it was from overwatering so eased up. Still happening though?,"I think some alocasia just tend to do that if they're not 100% thriving, my Black Velvet has done that a couple times too. Maybe a bit more light, I think it doesn't have enough energy maybe so it absorbs the old leafs energy"
167856,t3_kzwmsg,Got some Oxalis rhizomes from a mature plant. Potted in generic potting soil in a plastic nursery pot. Placed in med/bright indirect light. Shoots grew quickly but hang down.

I don't see anything unusual like bugs but i might be wrong. A few days ago i sprayed the plant. Could it be a reaction?","What did you spray it with? If you wipe it, does it come back? What does it look like when you wipe it? Does it have high humidity in its current location in your home? How long have you had the plant?"
200942,t3_mpeul2,English ivy has spider mites and is in plant jail. But where did they come from if it's the only plant?,"Spidermites can hide in the soil. Don’t do that either, take your plant outside and bring a new pot and new soil, pull your plant out of the old stuff and hose the entire plant off. Stems, roots and leaves. Give it a good gentle “power wash”. I did that with my lavender a few weeks ago and she’s doubled in size and is all happy."

135154,t3_j8uwk9,Was moving my plants around and this stem just fell off. I’m wondering if there’s something I can do to salvage it/make a prop out of it ?,You can totally propagate that! They actually root pretty quickly :)
19554,t3_ccoisu,"I recently bought an adansonii, it already had this discoloring in store. Is that normal or is this a sign of malnutrition?",I see a yellow leaf at the bottom.  I'd say overwatering and/or inadequate drainage/inappropriate soil.
70811,t3_ghukau,"I'm new to succulents, and got these guys a couple of months ago. Few weeks ago I moved them right up to my South-facing window. They seem happy, however the echeveria had a few dried up leaves in the bottom layer. Not sure if that is natural and happened before the move, or if it's too much light?",Definitely not too much light. Be careful not to overwater. Let the soil dry out completely between waterings. Keep them in the south facing window.
366260,t3_yexwd9,"My snake plant is drooping &amp; folding everywhere. Everything I can find says this is because of overwatering, but one of the leaves has completely dried out! What’s going on?",Overwatering that has led to root rot is my hypothesis. These particular plants thrive on neglect.
238180,t3_ok5avb,Over or under watering my patio tomato plant? The leaves are turning yellow and a few branches have fallen off. How can I save him?,"The lower leaves often go yellow and die, they're the oldest. It's very difficult to over water tomatoes as long as the pot has drainage hole and they're in well-draining soil as they usually need to be watered every day if they get all the sun they need. You can try pinching off a few leaves to make the plant concentrate on producing flowers and fruits instead of maintaining tons of leaves."
143382,t3_jnqmm2,"can someone please tell me what’s wrong with my syngonium? i really don’t think it’s an underwatering issue. it’s in a north-facing windowsill, is that too much light?",North facing windows in the northern hemisphere get the least amount of light. So maybe it’s overwatering but it’s hard to tell from just the one photo.
131379,t3_j2c0qu,Repotted my snake plant and noticed it barely has any roots. I’ve had it for a couple years near a north facing window and it hasn’t grown much. What can I do?,"It looks like you've been overwatering. Wash the roots with soap and water and let it dry out before repotting. I cant tell how big the plant is but sansiverias are quite hardy, so I think you can still try to repot it in well draining potting mix"

I went out last night with insecticidal soap &amp; couldn’t find the culprit. I live in northern Florida &amp; have an organic garden. Can anyone recommend a product or solution?",could it be a leaf cutter bee?
365327,t3_ybrg8m,My way too heavy and tall aloe finally fell over. Is there a way to replant it so it grows correctly?,"That's kinda the way they grow.  I'm in Arizona and they just grow crazy here.  They lay down and creep along the ground, as the older, lower leaves die back they get a long stem appearance, look messy. Don't know if there is a way to keep them upright."
365207,t3_ybio8z,I was given this Christmas cactus that was left in a garage and almost never watered. Are those filaments normal?,They're aerial roots! The plant is an epiphyte and grows up trees and such in it's natural habitat. Basically they emerged because your cactus was looking for more water (and was finding it in the air).
70465,t3_gh7809,"I put my spider plant outside for a few hours and came back to find some of the leaves are now soft, limp and withered. What's happening and how can I help it?","Too much outside. It wasn’t used to it and it got shocked.
Hopefully you moved it back to wherever it came from. In the future, if you move it outside.. make sure it is not in direct sun or in a temperature/environment that is vastly different. Immediate changes like that are no good for plants."
22359,t3_ckdlq2,"Trying to save my coworkers money plant! The leaves are drooping and turning yellow, a stem already fell off. I havent watered it in about a week since everything I read said droopy leaves meant it was overwatered. Any tips?"," It looks like it needs a larger pot and consistent watering. 

How much light does it get? Sometimes I move my sickly plants to a location with better light (not direct sunlight to avoid burning the leaves) and they perk up, like a sunny vacation."
12509,t3_bs483m,What’s going on with my prayer plant? This week 2 leaves turned yellow and now a third is starting. Can I save it?,"When mine did that I think it was related to the fact that I had been keeping the soil and air too dry around it for a bit. I was unable to stop it from dying back a little, but once I upped water and humidity the branches that survived seem okay months later. Sorry for your losses, good luck!"
239925,t3_onajqj,"my aglaonema is flowering! i thought this was a good sign but one of the older bottom leaves is also yellowing, is something wrong with it? and should i cut the flower once bloomed or leave it?","Damaged leaves won’t recover — just let your plant use the energy and pick it off when it’s loose. As for the inflorescence, they’re pretty boring flowers and use so much energy, so I personally chop them once they’re about this size."
132480,t3_j48273,"Hard to see but, little orange/red insects sucking the dear life out of rose bush? They're also on a ton of spider webs. I have neem but like to identify. Spider Mites?",I think so with the dense webbing getting started ... wash diluted neem and soapy water u got this!

8288,t3_bdg8gt,I think I left my avocado tree out on a day that was too cold. These leaves are hurting. Should I snip them off?,I'd remove them. Alternatively it could be sun damage if it was getting hit by direct sun after not acclimating to such light intensity. It also looks like it might be a bit nutrient deficient from the rightmost-center leaf coloration.
9265,t3_bhsjx4,I have some tiny flies on my tomato plant. Don’t seem to move much. What are they and are they feeding on the tomato or hurting it in any way?,Aphids.
29810,t3_d6w9nd,"My monstera has 2 leaves with these dark, soft spots. They've been there for a week and haven't spread to other leaves. Is this overwatering?","Yes, or rather a drainage issue. I got that colour a couple of years ago when I watered too often and didn’t provide enough sunlight. I just cut the damaged leaves off, let the plant dry out properly before watering again, and the plant bounced right back :)

(This summer, I had sun damage on some leaves, and that was a much lighter brown)"
120080,t3_ikk35k,I messed up! Pilea was near a jade plant with suspected spider mites. Trying to be proactive I used mild dish soap on the leaves and this morning I have ruined some leaves fully and some partially. How do I best minimize the damage?,The soap shouldn’t have done that. I dipped my whole plant’s leaves in a bucket of soapy water to kill pests and didn’t even wash it off after and the leaves were fine
119538,t3_ijn2dc,"I’m trying to propagate a pothos. I was expecting roots to come out of the stem where I cut, but I think they’re coming out of the nodes. Is this normal? Can I transfer them to soil like this?",That’s how they work. The nodes produce either roots or stems.
164,t3_6h1bm5,"Got this unknown plant as a gift. It is in some kind of moss ball and sits in a glass dish. Instructions were to soak it in water once a week (I do about two minutes until the whole ball seems wet.) The tips of some leaves are turning brown, and two centre leaves have turned brown and died. Ideas?","You might be overwatering it, and it might be too dry in your house. Asplenium are generally more tolerant of dry air and roots, but you do want to give it the occasional mist, as it's largely an epiphytic plant (like an air plant, it uses its roots to hang on to trees in the wild, not to drink all of its water) and the fronds will also do a lot to collect water. I'm light on watering mine, and heavy on misting, and keep it in the low light of my far bedroom wall away from the south facing window, and it seems super happy next to my queen fern and staghorn."

Not sure if that's what's going on with yours, but it could be, since it's so big. Maybe try propping it up and see if it firms back up - or you could remove the saggy arms and try propagating them :)"

329370,t3_va3hwa,This is a tree sappling I cut off a main root from a tree. Can this kind of tree propagate like this?,"You need a much smaller heel cutting. You can google how to take one if you aren’t familiar. You dont want more thickness than a matchstick or even a toothpick, typically. Also important to remember not all trees are capable of propagating

It will live in the water for a while but it will eventually die because trees aren’t typically meant to root in water. Try to plant a small heel cutting in soil and keep it damp, could take up to 1-2 months to root depending on the tree. Would also recommending getting **rooting hormone powder**, you can pick em up at a lot of plant shops, even home depot carries it. 

But take the heel cutting the thickness of a matchstick dip in hormone powder and remove as many leaves as possible but leave a minimal amount. This will put less water pressure on the cutting/root system when it develops.

But good luck! Propagating trees can be really difficult sometimes and the success rate can be limited.

**TL;DR: get rooting hormone powder, take a heel cutting the thickness of a matchstick remove almost all the foliage, plant in loamy soil, keep it damp, check for roots every couple of weeks for up to 3 months.**"

Sunburn you can do something about. The bacterial or fungal issues, you can't, a fungicide may help for a bit but it can spread. The minute those black spots get a yellow ring around them it's a done deal.

While I can't provide experienced advice (I'm only new to alocasias and they can be pretty tough compared to a lot of other plants), some info that may be useful for you to provide includes:

- What season is it currently where you are? What is the temperature and humidity like?

- How much light does it receive? What direction is the window and how far away is it from it?

- How often do you find it needs water? Does the soil stay overly moist for over a week?"

I’ve had polka dot plants for years and they’re awesome but they like a lot of light. You’ll notice if they aren’t getting enough when the new leaves sprout and are overwhelmingly green as opposed to colorful. Legginess is also an indicator of not enough light.  Additionally, these guys like to be pinched back. This plant is traditionally more of a ground cover plant. I wouldn’t do it rn because the plant isn’t doing the best but look up some YouTube videos on pinching back polka dot plants and you’ll see what I mean (also you can really easily propagate this way for even more of them).  It’s hard to tell from the pic but I think you may be watering too much. Mine only needed water about once a week but it wasn’t in a clay pot like this and they tend to soak up some of the water.

Personally I'd chop the stem down to a bit below the leaves but I think thats more of an aesthetic preference. Get a pot with well draining soil (miracle gro makes a succulent specific soil if you're new to plants and dont know about different substrate mixes) and make sure the pot itself has drainage holes, stick the stem in the soil, put it under as much light as you can, and then just watch and wait. Water only when the soil is completely bone dry, and when you do just absolutely flood the thing. Succulents are easy as long as you dont water them too much and give em plenty of sun. Overwatering = watering too often, as opposed to adding too much water at once. Err on the dry side, it's easier to bring a plant back from dehydration than overwatering."

Nice job taking the picture. Looks like apids to me. The way they congregate on the tip, the different sizes as they have extremely quick reproduction through parthenogenesis in spring, the raindrop shape, everything looks like apids to me.

The browning looks like low humidity, which is fixable. I’d avoid heavily misting this plant in order to raise that, but rather, use the hot sink/shower trick once per week.

44595,t3_ernf1i,Weird spot in peace lily leaf. There is another leaf with three smaller spots that seem less “pigmented”. Any help?,"Leaf spots are usually an indication of a disease/virus attacking your plant either initially from infected soil or an infected pest. Watering habits, lack of circulation, humid conditions allow fungi to thrive as well which sometimes can lead to spots.

If its a disease, it can definitely recover by trimming off the infected parts while considering applying a proper fungicide. If its a virus, unfortunately a lot time those plants will never recover as its permanently affected.

For example, Impatiens are notorious of being infected with a virus from Thrips that basically kills it off without any chance of recovering and even spreading to others. Symptoms start with spots on leaves and blackening of the stems."
1268,t3_7utvqf,My plant's leaves have been yellowing. Just noticed these things on the stems. Is it normal or a cause of concern?,"Yellowing pothos leafs means bad watering, could mean either too often, or too little.  In your case, too often.

Watering every few days is way too much.
I water mine every 12 days.  Of course it depends on how much sun it gets, humidity etc.. 

I would change to every 14 days, and monitor the soil, adjust the time frame as necessary.  The top 50% of the soil should be pretty dry before you water again.  Then water it good.

When in doubt, watering less often is ALWAYS better than watering too often.  Plants can recover from lack of water, watering too much kills them.

EDIT: In regards to your stems, looks normalish to me... I don't know the technical explanation of what it is, but mine has a bit of it, and its been healthy and growing for years.

309545,t3_tq7e44,Please help! The yellow is a little mushy. I removed all the yellow leave and changed the water from my city water to spring water. What else should I do the yellow leaves just came back!?,"These plants are NOT bamboo, but **dracaenas** and really should **not** be grown in water, contrary to this ridiculous trend that's been going on for years.

The stems are crazy long for what's left of the leaf system and struggles to get whatever nutrients it can get from water.

The plant on the right, with the **thick** yellow stalk, is likely a goner. It will slowly die and nothing can be done. 

First, cut that thick yellow stalk right at the **base** of the healthy growth. Do not harm the new growth directly below it. You **may** be able to save the new growth at the tip of the yellow stalk.

After getting rid of the thick yellow stalk, cut the healthy portion at the first ring BELOW the green leaves. 

For the one on the left, cut it down, at the ring just **BELOW** the small node sticking out.

Use a mixture of 1/3 potting soil, 1/3 perlite and 1/3 sand. Saturate the soil, since these guys are used to be drowned in water and need to acclimate to soil slowly. 

I would cut both plants down into sections of **two rings each** and plant in the above soil mixture."

Your tree is just adjusting to a new environment and that takes time. Look for new baby growth.

Gives the plant more energy to work with. Since it’s Calathea give it some decent humidity exposure, good indirect light and stay away from tap water and use distilled/rain water if you can and it’ll bounce back.

Also good to maybe just view the roots to make sure they’re not rotten when you first get a plant."

And the browning on the bottom of nearly all of the leaves...is it getting too much sun being under a skylight and next to windows?,"dracaena's typically prefer indirect light - the brown tips can be from that most definitely, but dracaena's are also sensitive to tap water due to the fluoride in it, which can also cause browning on the leaves.

with the drooping leaves it's usually an indicator that you have over watered the plant, but on the flip side it can also (not as common) be from severe underwatering!

She's been droopy since we repotted her. What do I do now?","  If the vines are long, it may take your plant more time to adjust to the repotting &amp; get that moisture delivered through its systems along those bones.   After a plant is up-potted,  it'll focus energies on root development &amp; adapting to its new situation.  Vibe it a week to recover from the repotting stress/ acclimation.   If the foliage doesn't start perking up in about a week,  look for causes of a disruption in the plant's delivery system:   vines bent at sharp angles,  vine bracing binding too tight,  etc.   If all is well above the soil surface,  you may need to explore causal factors below the soil surface:   poor root health,  air pockets around roots,  poor drainage of excess moisture from bottom of pot (soil doesn't have enough inorganic material or drainage holes are blocked).  If you don't find any obvious causes of the system disruption,  you can consider pruning the vines shorter,  to help the plant get nutrients to &amp; from the vines.   The pruned vines will resume growth to recover the lengths once it has restored its systemic strength &amp; vigor.   For now,  be patient for a week to see if it gets itself sorted,  before you do anything invasive to it."

I have a few of these and I water once a week with moderate light.  They are doing very well.   Yours is dropping leaves because it’s trying to survive.  If your only watering once a month than it’s far from root rot.   Root rot means it swims in water all the time.  These are tropical plants and need moist-ish soil, well drained, in porous soil.  Watering once a month and your forcing the plant to pull moisture from its leaves and dropping them to conserve moisture.  At this point, your forcing it into dormancy.    It’ll likely come back after it adjusts, plants often do a natural reboot when conditions get bad, but it’ll take time and proper care and light."

So what you’ll wanna do is get rid of that soil as soon as possible, prune off dead roots, give the roots a good hose down, apply treatment / insecticide and repot in a new pot with fresh, sterilised soil.

Make sure to keep the plant quarantined away from other plants and apply treatment weekly until you’re sure the mealybugs are gone. I’d look into different insecticides and neem oil for treatment, keep an eye out for root friendly treatments since you’re dealing with eggs and make sure to bottom water the plant to ward off mealybugs."

What did I do wrong?,"How often have you been watering this guy since transferring him to soil? Before I got the hang of my watering schedule, my vinca vine looked like this when he was thirsty. I try to keep soil on recently transferred propagations more moist than I would if it had grown in the pot so the plant doesn’t get shocked by the sudden transfer from water to soil. The terra-cotta pot it’s in could also be wicking away the moisture and drying out the soil more quickly- I’d recommend either watering more often until he’s settled in or moving him to a plastic pot and seeing how that works.

PS I just recently bought this same plant shelf!!"

126546,t3_iu2uu4,"Picked this guy up out of the $5 bin at HD and repoted into a mix of garden soil, peat moss, and perlite. What’s up with the bright green bases?","It probably needs a better draining soil and/ or less water. ZZs thrive on neglect and are very easy to overwater, and peat is dense and retains a lot of moisture. I’d check to make sure the roots aren’t rotten and repot in a cactus mix"
58620,t3_ftsd2c,"No leaves grow on this branch, goes on without any leaves for a meter more. Should I cut it? Why are there no leaves growing?","These plants are programmed to climb trees and they're really good at it. If you've ever seen people growing them up moss poles, the nodes of the vine will root into the pole and give it support, pushing the new leaves up the moss pole (or in nature, a tree). The point of this is to chase that dappled sunlight that shines through just below a tree's canopy.

Well eventually we're gonna run out of space at the top of a tree, and it won't be efficient for the pothos to grow up there anymore. So instead, it starts climbing back down the tree. Since there's not much light, the priority for the vine is really just to get to a better location where it the energy cost of building a leaf will pay off, so the internodes become much longer between leaves.

Eventually the vine reaches the jungle floor and spreads across the ground. It'll throw out tons of nodes and root into the ground, and grow like this until it finds another tree to climb.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: Basically your pothos needs more light to grow in with more leaves. Cutting the vine will give you a fresh start if that's what you want, but giving it more light will make future leaves grow in bushier."

Also, did you orient the leaf in the same direction it was growing?

I don't think you have enough healthy tissue to work with but you can sure try again. 

Cut off every bit of squishy yellow plus some into the healthy green. Spray well with undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide. This will help to kill bacteria and mold that could be lurking.

Let dry in a place with good air circulation for about a week. I need to check how long I let mine callous over.  If it's different, I'll correct this.

Honey is good for dry soil environments but not wet ones like this in my opinion. 

Once it's calloused over, place in a glass with water about two-ish inches deep. Make sure it is not upside down. 

I clipped mine to the rim so the bottom edge was not resting on the bottom of the glass.

Change the water every few days.

&gt; They get water when the top layer of soil is dry

and 

&gt; indirect light most of the day

First of all, what is the top layer of soil?! There are no layers in soil. And, if you think about the top of the soil, there really aren't any roots in that portion anyhow. Pothos need the soil to dry completely prior to be watered. Additionally, you should be watching the foliage. When it begins to feel soft and the tips *just* begin to droop are the signs that you need to watch for prior to watering. 

You said that it gets indirect light ""most of the day"". What about the other portion of the day? What is it getting then? If I'm looking at this photo correctly, the foliage is all leaning toward the left, which I'm guessing is the light source. This suggests to me that it needs more light. For reference, I keep my Marble Queen in an east window where it gets a bit of direct light in the morning. Sometimes, that light is filtered. 

I think that if you increase the light and cut back on watering that you'll see a much happier plant. Best of luck!"

Alocasia tend to prefer more moist soil so it could be drying out too often between waterings. Mine always do better in the summer when I'm watering every other day but in the winter tend to wilt and lose leaves more often because I forget about them and only water every 10 days or so.

Even though snails have their benefits in the enrichment of your plant's ecosystem (they can eat fungus for example), if their population is not controlled, they can easily kill your plant in a matter of weeks. As they might already have reproduced, check for the eggs. You can then invite them to leave either manually or using copper or eggshells as repellent (they know copper is lethal to them so why staying in a coppery environment and they don't like sliding on eggshells, so do we) or kill them with neem oil or other things.

What should I do?","Ok so I’m no expert but I’ve been watching a bunch of aloe Vera care videos because I just rescued one from my mom which wasn’t looking too hot. All the videos I’ve watched have said that when the leaves start to fall and drop down that it’s from overwatering. I guess the leaves fill up too much and get too heavy which is what’s causing them to fall over. When they’re thirsty, what I’ve found is that, the leaves will start to look more concave instead of nice and plump...idk how to explain it, maybe think of a slide? If the leaves look like slides instead of plump, then you water deeply (until it drains out the holes) and then don’t water again until the soil is dry and the leaves start to look thirsty again. 
Also, it looks like you have a soil that’s too dense (if that’s the right wording?) and not draining fast enough, (which could be how you’re overwatering, if you don’t feel like you’re watering that often, maybe the soil is just staying wet for too long) you’ll need cactus/succulent/well draining mix of soil, think of them like cacti. They don’t need a whole lot of water, and not as often as you’d probably think. 
Sorry I know this is long but saw a post that was asking for help in an area that I could actually offer some advice and got excited lol. 
TD;DR: probably overwatering, leaves start to droop and fall from being too heavy from all the water they’re taking in. Repot with a well draining cactus mix soil, water only when soil is dry and leaves start to curl a bit. Check the roots make sure it doesn’t have root rot from overwatering when repotting. .Good luck!"
237370,t3_oisjm5,What’s going on here!? Why the discoloration and some of the leaves are dripping water? Is this norm?,This happens if you recently watered your plant and meant it to well.

158945,t3_kie9ls,SOS this plant at my work is not doing well. I’ve been watering it 1 cup once a week... it gets white gunk all over it. Any suggestions? Should I cut the brown leaves off?,"Ok, so these guys are super tough, which means they often get bad advice thrown at them. 

Worse, they are propped from cane cuttings, and sold as soon as the foliage looks nice, with under-developed roots shoved in a too small pot full of thick, organic rooting medium. Then people keep them in there, //for years//, because these guys are tough enough to take it. 

I recommend repotting ASAP.

The brown leaves will naturally shed as the plant grows new, healthier leaves. 

**Best Care Guide:**

Ideally; these guys like a lean, well draining soil, and a pot with really good drainage. They should be watered thoroughly (until it runs from the drain), and then not again until the top few inches are dry. They HATE soggy - it gives them yellowing/browning leaves. Never let water pool at the bottom of the pot.

You will also run into problems if the soil is too rich, organic, or moisture retaining. Dracaena find this kind of soil suffocating (**Here's where well meaning people throw out advice like ""only give 1 cup of water per week - to keep the plant from suffocating**). I recommend a cacti/succulent mix or an equal mix of potting soil, coarse sand and perlite.

They also do not like to dry out completely - it gives the leaves crispy tips. This advice is often misinterpreted as ""keep wet"". They should not be kept wet.

Other things that make these guys frown/brown; direct sunlight (they burn!), chlorine/fluoride in the water, excessive fertilizer or salt/mineral build up in the soil.

**The White Gunk**:

 Sounds like mealy bugs. Which is another separate issue. I recommend treating with a pesticide as you repot."

Best thing to do is to quarantine to avoid any spreading to other plants, spray down your leaves and stems with a soapy solution (a biodegradable dish soap and water works well), ensure the plants is dripping wet, wipe each individual leaf and stem dry, then keep an eye on it. You might want to do this a few times a week over the next few weeks to ensure there is no return/resurgence of the bugs. You could also spray with neem oil or a combination treatment of the two. Hope this helps! Good Luck!"

It'll just look kind of ugly. 

With plants you plan on growing indoors, it's best to just find a place they're happy in your house, and leave them there. Plants like to adjust themselves to their environment, and they can have a hard time adjusting if they're moved frequently (especially if they're attempting to recover). 

The most important thing for a recovering plant is consistency. You want every day to be almost exactly like the previous one, in terms of care. The less you do to it during this time, the better. Make sure it's getting enough light, and that you're watering when it needs it... but other than that, try to leave it alone. Struggling plants have a much lower tolerance of 'interference' from their human caretakers."

My best guess would be that your plant probably has a nutrient deficiency rather than HLB/citrus greening because of the pattern in which the chlorosis is occurring.  

HLB greening usually isn’t as uniform on the leaf and it typically impacts the veins before the space in between the veins. (Opposite of what your picture is showing)

It looks like you may have zinc or magnesium deficiencies.  Check out this link for more visual references for specific nutrient deficiencies.

But I'm terrified it could be oak wilt, or some bacterial infection.  I did some pruning in late spring, and a little more in the early summer, which makes me concerned possibly the oak wilt fungus infiltrated the tree at that time.

In the linked image gallery, the last photo shows that even a little volunteer sapling near the base has the spots, too.

158989,t3_kihums,Adopted a peace lily that wasn't doing well. It has fungus gnats(?). I put the yellow sticky traps up and these tiny black dots appeared. What are they?,"Comment for more information:


She was very droopy and no new leaves for around a yr. I was given her to possibly provide better lighting/home. After a few weeks of having her- I noticed flies coming out of the soil. I searched up that it was possibly fungus gnats. I am a bit of newbie as I just got into plants this year so pardon my lack of knowledge. 


I also read that the hydrogen peroxide treatment helps so I have been giving her that for past two weeks now with her watering. I water on a weekly basis as she visibly droops by the 7th day mark.  She was last repotted 1.5 mths ago when we checked the roots for rot(nothing) as a cause for her drooping/lack of new leaves. 


Hope this info helped. I would really appreciate any input. Thank you"

336260,t3_vspc87,"My grandma gifted me this split leaf for my birthday. It’s my first large plant and I’ve tried everything to figure out why it’s turning brown. I’ve watered more, watered less, tried different lightings, nothing helps. Anyone have any advice? Is it sick?","Browning at the edges is usually some kind of water uptake problem.  Either something is off with your dosage of water ( how much or how frequent) or something is off with your soil ( drying too fast or not drying at all)

If it’s not showing other “thirsty “ signs besides browning… meaning going a bit soft or limp, or the soil drying into dust or a thick puck… repot it and give it a good looking over.

If a plant has been too wet for whatever reason, it will develop root problems.  Fixing the way you water will not heal the roots.  You have to cut away the rotting areas and repot in clean dry soil.  If you’re watering reasonably but it’s not drying out, your “overwatering “ symptoms can be because the soil is too good at holding the water in.  So use something that drains better during a repot."

336448,t3_vt5v4z,two of my tomato plants look sick: a Bush Early Girl Tomato Plant &amp; a Sun Cherry Tomato Plant. The leaves on both plants are turning yellow on the bottom and white on the top. Should I be concerned?,"Direct sunlight on wet foliage doesn’t burn, it’s a myth.  Think about it for a second, water evaporates at 100 degrees Celsius and as long as it hasn’t evaporated it COOLS the leaf and doesn’t warm it as opposed to what most people think.  This process is called evaporative cooling and is used in swamp coolers.  Same thing that happens when it’s super hot and you wet your hair.

The yellowing is most likely due to nitrogen deficiency which in most plants starts from the bottom and works it’s way up.  Nitrogen is a mobile element within the plant and so the plant translocates it from where it is less needed, the old foliage, to where it’s most needed, the new growth.

Very common at this ti,e of year as the plants switch to mostly reproductive mode, aka fruiting, and so the need for nutrients rises significantly.

297092,t3_sm0w79,Please help - friend gave me a very sick Areca palm to bring back to life. Any idea what all this brown growth is?,"That is black sooty mold. It is a type of mold that grows in the honeydew secreted by many common plant pests, such as aphids or scale. The pests cover the leaves of your plant in honeydew and the sooty mold spore lands on the honeydew and begins to reproduce. The mold isn’t going to kill the plant but the pests on there will. 

The first thing to do is remove all the dead brown pieces. Then make a 1:1 mixture of water:alcohol with roughly a drop of dawn dish soap per ounce of mixture. Spray the plant down with that and wipe the leaves with paper towels. This will remove the mold, honeydew, and any of the what I assume are aphids that caused this to begin with.

You should water when the soil is dry, which is not always going to work on a weekly schedule. I check my plants on a weekly schedule but only water when they need it.

Brought it back and shop owner said they are natural pests and not harmful. Not sure I believe it. Any ideas on what these are and if they are, in fact, harmful?",My guess is thrips. Definitely harmful. You can use water with a squirt of soap and neem oil on them or an insecticide. Make sure you wipe down all the leaves thoroughly and after a couple of days give it another treatment. You can also rinse the plant off in the shower first.
278444,t3_qyskp8,Bought this alocasia pink dragon from a garden centre and it came in this natural fibre (?) pot.

154236,t3_k89tbq,what pest is this on my monstera? it was all over the leaves. no webbing so i dont think its spidermites. i washed all the leaves with castille soap and water and showered him pretty well- anything else i can do?,"That looks like thrip damage. You’ll want to start a treatment over the next month to eradicate them. 

That involves wiping the undersides of the leaves at least several times a week to physically remove eggs and larvae, as well as a spray treatment using a combination of insecticidal soap (I like Des-X) and Neem Oil (Neemix is good, Monterey brand is good). You need both of them to eliminate the thrips. You may also use blue sticky traps just above the soil to catch adult thrips. (Yellow sticky traps are more for fungus gnats, so use those if you happen to spot those as well.) 

Only apply the spray at night, in the dark, and allow the leaves to drip dry after the treatments. Also allow the top layer of soil to soak up the treatment. Use eye protection and gloves when applying any pesticides treatment. 

Exposing the drenched leaves to UV light causes permanent damage while the treatment is applied (phytotoxocity) and preferably, spray in a room that you don’t mind smelling like insecticides. Maintain good air flow and humidity. Do not fertilize. When you re-pot (preferably wait till spring) you can introduce a systemic insect repellent into the soil to prevent future infestations. Bonide is pretty good for this. 

Regardless of whether or not your plants are being fed upon by pests, always wipe down the leaves (especially undersides) with water each week, as best you can. 

For long-term plant health, you can water with distilled water instead of tap, increase air flow in your plant room, keep the temperature as consistent as possible, and apply a Garlic Barrier spray to leaves once a month to keep pests at bay. 

Hope this helps!"

It is in bright indirect light, hasn’t moved, and is still in her nursery pot. The bottom leaves have started to brown and fall off. Help?","I have 2 possible explanations. 1. Your fiddle is adjusting to new lighting and humidity. Those older leaves were adjusted to greenhouse conditions and aren’t suited to household parameters, so your plant is getting rid of them OR 2. Your plant is root-bound and having trouble taking up enough water/nutrients. Either way the new growth looks really healthy, and usually 2-4 weeks is plenty of adjustment time between bringing a plant home and repotting. Hope this helps!"

184548,t3_lvbz7m,Found this beautiful queen.... I noticed some spots on her and I had to cut some leaves that were dark brown- crunchy and soggy- which I’m assuming from maybe over watering... can anyone help me with the best way to treat these other spots??,"Agree with everything already said, but also (assuming the spots are not on all the leaves, right?), remove all the infected leaves right away!!! If it's bacterial/pests, those can all spread fast, and it's best to be safe and get the infected leaves far, far away ASAP. If it winds up just being a little bit of overwatering and this is an overreaction, the plant will bounce back, but it's sooooo hard to deal with a big infection. Also, get it away from your other plants!!!

The annoying bit is that the treatment for bacterial spots vs. pests is pretty different. To try and figure out if it's pests, you can use a magnifying glass to inspect your plant's leaves, and/or take a blank sheet of white paper, shake the leaves over it, and see if you can see any tiny black or brown dots on the paper. If it does turn out to be pests, you can try wiping down all the leaves (on all your plants! they spread so fast!!) with a soap and water mixture like twice a day, and maybe spray with some neem oil to be extra safe.

If you do all that and don't see any signs of pests, I'd probably assume it's an infection and get some copper. Also, scrub your hands super, super well after you touch it so you don't spread it. 

She's beautiful, good luck!!"

First of all, I'm very concerned about this potting mix. If you're not using a good succulent mix, I suggest adding A LOT more perlite to this. It should literally be 40-50% perlite. 

Secondly, you don't want to root the ends of these. You need to propagate the entire vine. In the wild, these guys creep along the ground and root all along the length of their vine. They were never meant to be planted with roots on just one end. [Here a lame tutorial](https://imgur.com/a/KANy4O4) that I made to help others understand how to propagate them. Then, absolutely do NOT mist them. Use either a pipette or an eyedropper. You moisten the areas along the length of the vine about twice a week. I literally see growth within 24 hours when I do this. Once established, the soil needs to dry 100% before you water. Then, don't water yet, but watch for the epidermal windows to thin to a slit and for the foliage to begin to feel soft when held between your fingers. Make sure that it gets really bright light, including some direct sun. For reference, I keep mine in an east window so that they get direct morning light. That's it. Best of luck!"

It seems to be transmitting to all plants I keep on my windowseal. Will universal bug spray do the job? What is it?,I think those are aphids and any insecticide for plants (such as neem oil) should be fine.
300167,t3_svl4ma,"What happend? She was repotted 2weeks ago, i wasnt home but my brother have her water once, soil still moist, and now she looks like this. What do I do?",Honestly I would wait. It may be root rot or just not liking the soil. But since it's still moist I would give it time and keep lightly watering it once it has dried out. I've heard stories from people where calatheas came back months after losing all their leaves. And repotting it again may cause more damage and reduce its energy reserves more. But this is just speculation to be honest. Good luck!

39194,t3_e6hm3x,I bought this marble queen pothos on Saturday but in my excitement I didn’t pay attention to all the browning leaves. What’s going on with it and how do I fix it??,Probably overwatered at the shop. Just avoid overwatering it yourself and the new leaves will come in healthy.

182115,t3_lqmua4,Root rot? I’m terrified of remedying this. I’m concerned I’ll kill him. I do just him every day because our heater is running. Is that the issue? Any advice or reputable sources?,"Hi there!  I'll throw my two cents in as well- it could be the dry air from the vent, but regular misting or adding a humidifier near the plant would do wonders if that's the problem.  If it's root rot, you definitely want to take care of this quickly!  Luckily, it looks like your plant is still in the nursery pot, so it may make these next steps easier.

I'd take it over to the sink or tub and \*\*carefully\*\* pull it out of the pot.  You may need to squeeze the sides of the pot to get it to come loose.  Then take a look at the roots.  They should be dry, firm, and look like spaghetti.  If they're brown and mushy, then, unfortunately, they're rotten.  But, if that's the case, with a little TLC and a consistent watering schedule, you plant should be ok!"
153217,t3_k67jd9,"We got this alcoasia a few weeks ago and it started dropping leaves, they're also turning translucent. Anyone know what's up?",Yellowing leaves usually indicate that you're watering too often. Let the top inch or two of soil dry completely between waterings.

317473,t3_udwgvt,My beautiful philodendron birkin is starting to get some brown edges. I just sprayed it with some neem. I don’t see pests - but maybe a sign of spider mites?,"Nope. It's the joy of variegation.  White leaves contain no chlorophyll (? Not sure if that's the correct word) but only the green of the plant produces the starch/sugar/food needed to maintain the quality of the leaf. You can increase your humidity.  That may help slow the process a little. But in the end,  that just happens. Look at all the plants with white leaves,  they always turn quickly. However, you have yourself a beautiful Birkin! You can try trimming it off. Just do so in the shape of the leaf... it will happen again and just keep trimming if you are itchin for the perfect Instagram plant."

Definitely wait to see what happens now that you watered it, and I am so curious about it! In general, if the roots are in good conditions, it will grow back.

301155,t3_symhzl,Hey! Monstera Albo here! Not sure if it looks good? It just arrived. The root system is very healthy....but the person who i bought it from says its 2yr old! Why wouldn't it have produced a leaf in that time? Other than being very wet right now. Can anyone see any issues here? Or have any advice?,You can clearly see that the auxiliary bud already pushed out a new leaf which was chopped of. Normally that means the chance of the stem activating a new one (if there is one) is low. You could buy keiki paste and put it on the stem to see if it activates some grow. The side stem with the small aerial root would have been the stem part where the auxiliary bud would appear but it’s chopped pretty short and the upper part looks brown. It’s possible to get an auxiliary bud activated on the woody stem parts but it need a lot more Time. Good luck and hopefully something will grow

Help?,"If you want this plant to be around for the long haul, you need to get a pot with proper drainage otherwise you'll continue to run into this underwater/overwater issue. With proper drainage, it allows a lot more room for error when it comes to figuring out a proper watering routine. There are a plethora of other reasons I recommend getting her into a pot with better drainage but ultimately it's your choice. My personal recommendation is keeping your plants in nursery pots and then placing them into decorative ones so that you still get to enjoy the beautiful aesthetic of the decorative pot.

It sounds super scary but I did that to  two of my alocasias the last month and they immediately put out new growth once they didn't have to be focusing on the damaged parts of the plant.

I had a couple plants that I had staked to high heaven and back, and once I repotted them in deeper pots they didn’t need any stakes or support.

Should I be concerned?,"That is actually powdery mildew and needs to be treated: [https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/powdery-mildew](https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/powdery-mildew)

""Powdery mildew Most gardeners are familiar with powdery mildew. It occurs when there is low light, improper circulation, cooler temperatures, and excess humidity. Overhead watering leaves foliage damp, which in winter months tends to stay moist for a long period. 

This promotes the formation of fungal spores that cause powdery mildew. Avoid overhead watering and use a fan to increase circulation. 

**Pinch off affected foliage and discard it. A solution of baking soda and vinegar is how to get rid of white spots on jade plants with powdery mildew. Spray on the leaves but ensure the leaves dry within a few hours.** Overhead watering may also leave hard water spots on leaves.

Cause if so, it wants more light! Bright indirect sunlight, for at least 6 hours a day and complete darkness for at least 6 hours a day… the rest of the light can be less…. And here’s some general watering rules to help out just about anyone: general watering rules: only water when top two inches of soil are dry, when you do water fully saturate the root ball, make sure there’s holes in the bottom of pot for excess water to drain, when potting up in order to avoid soil that stays wet for too long only pot up to a pot that is two inches bigger in diameter. Also for some plants only watering with pure/distilled water is recommended, rain water and reverse osmosis are two common types of water used in this case"

Trips are tiny black, white or brown pest you can barely see with the naked eye. 
I would recommend to isolate it, so nothing spreads to any other plants. Put the plant in your shower / bath tube and shower it off every other day for a week or so. Then repeat after a week and look throughly for any pest on the leaves. Spraying it down with some diluted neem oil is also an option, but make sure to keep your pothos out of direct or bright sunlight since it can burn the leaves.

I repotted and watered it immediately but I think I overwatered it because it quickly began losing leaves and drooping. Now it's turning brown. Can I save it??,"It might recover, it might not. Killing plants is part of learning how to care for them. I have killed more than a few in my time, lol. For future reference, I usually never repot a plant immediately on bringing it home. The stress of having sudden new living arrangements can be a lot. Also the stress of being transported multiple times is also pretty significant. When I bring mine home they are usually left alone for about two weeks.  I'll check the soil every few days to see if they need water, but that's the only thing I do. Once they are acclimated to their new surroundings I'll check roots and see if they need to be repotted.  But for those first two weeks or so I don't do anything to them. That seems to work best for me."

This usually works if the infestation is not very bad"
43654,t3_eodaxn,Orchid - was giving this guy to attempt to save - but never dealt with an orchid before. Is this guy salvageable??,Yes. Soak it in filtered water for several hours and then put some peat moss of something like it around the roots to help hold humidity. Then take a vase or something and put chucky rocks at the bottom so that you can have water in it but set plant on top of rocks so it's not touching the water but still receives a lot of humidity if that makes sense. Mist often. Get roots wet once a week or so depending on where you live. Some leaves will die but it can be revived with lots of care.

Like eg I learned lately that if they cut trees out of the earth and move them to another place to replant, they size down the trees root system from approx 6m diameter to about 1m diameter. By cutting the tips of the roots, the tree loses its sense for depth and from then on only grows horizontal roots. That's why replanted trees will never be truly stable.

So what I want to go for is that maybe some depth orientation function is not going properly for this one. Why not?
Very funny though! Maybe you could just let it do its thing and have a peculiar one? :D"

Should I still water weekly?","Sounds like your FLF's roots still haven't branched out much - they suck the water out of the soil where they are located, but the soil that has no roots retains its water.

Maybe just water the central portion more than the outer parts? Still water both though, or the roots will have no stimulus to spread.

And if you already have the luxury of a moisture meter, why do you insist on watering 'weekly'? Makes no sense (generally makes no sense to water anything on a schedule)."

Yours is probably Nematanthus but I'm not betting money. :) They often look a bit ragged after a hard winter.  You can pinch out the very last two leaves on each vine to encourage branching. You can also go wild with the shears and give it a strong haircut. The cuttings will root extremely easily. Feed by putting a generous pinch or two of balanced fertilizer (10-10-10 for example, or any food with a 2:1:3 ratio) in the watering can."

75062,t3_goj672,Found this guy in Home Depot yesterday severely dried out and left to die. I took him home to nurse him back to life but this morning his leaf turned from green to this. Any suggestions?,"I’m by no means an expert, so please guys correct me if any info seems like a bad idea. But I’ve had two alocasia plants one the brink of death in my past due to my own inexperience. I was able to save both of them :) Please follow the advice that Aroex gave. Keep a close eye on it and wait to see if things improve. Keep it in a place with higher humidity since it’s a tropical plant. In my experience, alocasia can be a bit temperamental if there’s something in their environment they don’t like. 

If another leaf drops and dies, then you know that there’s something wrong and you might need to take extra measures. 

Did you repot him? Gently pop him out and look at the roots. Alocasia like to be root bound so if they are crowded then that’s normal and healthy. Are the roots white and plump or soft? Is the soil too compact and not letting water drain properly? 

My first plant was overwatered and developed root rot. It honestly looked a lot like your picture and was super close to death because I had lost most of the leaves. I removed the unhealthy roots, sprayed the plant and roots with a fungicide, and replanted it in some fresh, well-draining soil that I had put together using coco coir, houseplant soil, and perlite. It did really well after that and shot out new growth until I went on an extended trip and my husband killed it. 

Second one wasn’t root rot. I still have no idea what caused it. I sprayed it again for fungus and split the plant since it was very big. One I put in fresh soil like above, and the other I popped into a clear jar of water. I’ve heard in the past that if you ever have a plant near death you can almost always save it by doing this. Not sure if this is true but it worked for me because it developed new water roots and I was able to remove the old roots. This happened fairly recently so I need to do research on how to transplant it back to soil. But tbh I’m tempted to put it in a fancy glass vase or jug and see how it likes that. 

I’m sorry this turned out to be so long. I hope you were able to take out a little bit of info from it 

tl;dr if the leaves continue to turn then check the soil for how well it drains or if there’s any rot. Maybe repot it in better soil or put into water"

116177,t3_iezsg3,- Coco moss pole do you mist it regularly/ everyday ? Also should you attach aerial roots on to the moss pole ???,"You can encourage *new* aerial roots to attach by just giving them the option (having the pole near where they emerge), but those long aerial roots I would get into the soil. They'll be far more beneficial to the plant there, where they can provide additional nutrients. 

To be honest, I'm a bit concerned about the plant's placement on the pole. I mean, the pole is in the correct location as you have it behind the natural lean of the plant. However, and correct me if I'm wrong, it looks like a lot of the foliage is bunched up around the pole. The petioles need ventilation, so this can be problematic. It also looks like the bunching is preventing the foliage from getting sufficient light, as if some leaves are blocking light from the others. If this is the case, I would release a few of those petioles from the pole to give them better airflow and the leaves more light. 

I just noticed something potentially damaging. It looks like some of the petioles have their bases buried beneath the soil. This generally causes them to rot, so that you lose that foliage. If i'm seeing this correctly, you need to remedy that situation asap. If the plant was recently watered, you can just remove some of the excess soil as a temporary measure until the plant is dry enough to be repotted again. It's a very common mistake and easy to resolve if caught in time."

13797,t3_bvxxl9,"While repotting I saw these little pink bugs on my Haworthia, limited to the bottom of the plant/babies. What are they and what can I do now?","Those are definitely mealy bugs, and kind of a lot of them. Pick up a bottle of 70% isopropyl alcohol, put it in a spray bottle and spray it directly onto your haworthia, including the roots. The haworthia's tough skin can tolerate alcohol, but spray it indoors or in the shade and let it dry completely before you expose it to any sun or it can cause burned spots. It looks like you've got enough of an infestation that they're lurking in the soil for sure, so you should ditch your old soil, spray the inside of your pot with alcohol, give the roots a gentle cleaning and rinsing after you spray them with alcohol and repot it with new soil. Doing that should kill them off, but mealy bugs are tiny, very sneaky little bastards that crawl into roots of my plants through the drainage holes in pots and invade from the bottom up. They've caused a lot of my succulents to grow deformed and rot from the center because they attack the new growth before I can even see them. The isopropyl alcohol kills them on contact, and once it evaporates it doesn't cause any harm to bees, butterflies, birds, etc., so it's a great option. Since mealy bugs prefer roots and new growth on succulents and they like to hide in crevices between leaves, keep a close eye on it (and your other plants) for a while and retreat it with alcohol as needed. Be very glad you spotted them this early!"

2977,t3_92eycp,"Calibrachoa hybrid, Superbells Cherry Blossom. Soil smells bad, probably overwatered. Can it be saved?","That baby is dead. But there’s a serious learning curve when it comes to plants so don’t get yourself down yet!
I suspect it rotted from overwatering and that’s the cause of your smelly soil. Calibrachoa is a common annual that likes full sun and is able to dry out a bit between waterings. The fact that it’s sitting in a window sill makes me think it would’ve enjoyed more sun and would have done best outdoors.
If you want to try again, your local garden center likely has their annuals on sale now. If you try again, repot into a larger pot and put er outside in full sun. 

When it comes to watering, the best way to learn, I think, is to feel the weight of the wet plant. The top inch of soil could be dry, but the roots can still be sitting in water at the bottom of the pot. 
So you want to water until it runs out the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot. Then feel the pot. Lift it and get a feel for it. Check the next day, if it’s still heavy or similar to the same weight (if you can’t remember), don’t water it. Water it when you almost throw it cause you expected it to be heavier. You can let it wilt slightly before you give it water. You can come back from dry, but you can’t come back from rot.

12356,t3_brp9t6,"Every day, my cacti receive a lot of sunlight. As a result, the soil dries out very quickly (after a few hours). Should I water them more than once a week?","To answer your immediate question, no, I wouldn’t water more frequently.

But your picture raises a couple of other considerations. How long have you had these plants in this setup?

It kind of looks like you’ve got two problems here that are cancelling each other out for now: This soil seems way too heavy and moisture retaining for succulents (and the top dressing of rocks will further compound that problem).  Cacti like to have very grainy and loose soils so that water pours through quickly.  This looks like a very peat-y soil.  (And it appears that the plants are in plastic pots which are placed into terra cotta, is that correct?) Those should hold a lot of water - way more than would dry completely in a day or two, (unless they’re outdoors in the heat of the day?)  and more than would be ideal for succulents. 

If it’s drying out that quickly then it’s likely not being watered thoroughly enough.  As another post mentioned, whenever you water you typically want to ensure that you’re saturating the soil and not just pouring 100ml on top. (By watering until water pours out the drainage holes, waiting 2 minutes, and watering again until water pours out. Double watering is especially helpful for succulents because they should be so dry when they’re finally watered that the soil may become slightly hydrophobic, and two waterings ensures that all soil is saturated.)  But if this soil isn’t very fast draining, then that will be way too much water for these plants. 

So it looks like your soil is too heavy, and you’re under watering for general plant health,  but those two issues are offsetting each other because these are cacti. It’s not an ideal set up but you can make it work if you’re careful and lucky.  The problem is that if/when it fails you might not be able to save the plants because it will be difficult to tell which issue is causing the problems."

10750,t3_bmtbiz,"What are these little white dots on my plant? I’ve been fighting what I believe is spider mites with rubbing alcohol, does this have something to do with that?","This could be damage from spider mites, or even mites themselves although I've only had the red type. The webbing between the leaves would certainly make that more likely. Do the dots wipe off with a q-tip dipped in alcohol? Are there any small dark or red spots that could be the mites?

It could also just be minerals if the plants are saturated with fertilizer, which always happens with my jade plants but if you haven't fertilized yet this spring its unlikely to be the case. In that case they will wipe off and aren't a problem.

Rubbing alcohol usually works great at around 50% concentration (typically sold at 70%+ so you'd be watering it down) and a couple drops of dish soap in mix doesn't hurt. I use q-tips for a few visible bugs but spray it when I know there's a major infestation."

163271,t3_krsxwf,The leaves on my Peperomia Rosso are faded and drooping. I’m not sure if it’s due to being overwatered or not enough sunlight?,"In my experience, kist common mistake is overwatering. Peperomias have quite meaty leaves and can hold on to water similar to succulents. When underwatered, they'll turn soft and wrinkly, giving you enough time to react. So I'd put it on a towel to soak up all excess water and just let it be for a few days. Those leaves are probably going to fall off even if you do everything right, so don't be shocked by that.

First things first it looks a little cramped up. It enjoys having some space between various stems. I would re-pot it in a bigger pot. 
Also, keep it on a window still, better if there’s a very light curtain, so that the leaves won’t get burnt. 
Keep the soil damp, not wet.
Get the top leaves with a clean scissor, so that the larger leaves on the bottom keep the soil shielded from direct sunlight. 
If the basil ever flowers, pinch the flower off so to keep the plant year round (when the flower blooms the plant dies shortly after).

125887,t3_it6vff,"My jade was in a pot with terrible draining and I over-watered her. She's in a new pot (same size) with fresh soil, but dropped a bunch of leaves and shriveled up. :( Can I save her?","I agree with the others, this one looks too far gone. 

But don't let this get you down. Use this opportunity to learn, and use your new knowledge for your next plant. :) 

Judging from what I can see in your photo, the soil holds way too much water. Get a well draining soil mix (like a cactus or succulent soil) and then mix in a whole lot of extra perlite for even better drainage. Remove the plastic pot and keep your succulent in the terracotta pot (assuming it has a drainage hole). Unglazed terracotta helps even further with drying out the soil by wicking away moisture on all sides. It's the best. 

The current pot might also have been too big. This is impossible to say without knowing the size of the root mass, so it's just a hunch based on what I see. In a pot that is too big, there is too much soil, and that soil will likely hold on to excess water for too long. 

The best way to avoid overwatering is to look for the plants thirst cues instead of watering on a schedule. This is especially useful for succulents and other drought tolerant plants. Wait until the soil is completely dry, and then wait a little longer still. The leaves will start to deflate as the plant starts using its internal water storage. They'll feel softer and less full. When it gets to this point, you know the plant is thirsty, so you give it a good, thorough soak. Water until the soil is evenly saturated and allow excess water to run out through the bottom drainage hole (and down the drain). When it's stopped dripping from the drainage hole, put the plant back in its dish or cache pot.

If the soil stays wet for a long time after a thorough watering, it's because of the soil - not the water. Change the soil (and/or the pot) instead of decreasing the amount of water.

So: Smaller pot, better draining soil, and water thoroughly when dry. And plenty of light! Good luck! :)"

203971,t3_mu7h21,"Asking for help again- my ivy STILL has spider mites.... he’s been in quarantine for about a month now and I consistently spray with neem oil and I even wiped down each leaf with rubbing alcohol. My mom is starting to get mad and wants the bathroom back, what do I do?","Sorry to hear you are struggling with spider mites! They are such a persistent pest. Unfortunately, consistency is key here, and you have to repeat treatments 2-3 times a week and then ween off the treatments once you no longer see them.

They can also become resistant to certain treatments, so perhaps experiment with different techniques each time you treat your plant.

I personally like to put a bag around the pot and tie it around the base of the plant (So soil doesn't go everywhere). Turn the plant upside down and spray using a strong blast from the shower head. Get under ever leaf. You'll have to do this every 2-3 days, but evaluate the state of the plant as you go.

In most cases, I like to repot a plant that has spider mites. I do the above but also rinse the roots of the plant off too and get rid of the old soil. Obviously be careful as some plants can be sensitive to shock, but at this point I usually care more about the spider mites killing my plant!

 Apparently insecticidal soap (aka Potassium salts of fatty acids or pure soap) is great for spider mites.  Mix 1 tablespoon in with 1 litre of water and spray it liberally all over the plant until it is dripping and every leaf is covered. 

Good luck! Do report back with an update if you can. :)"

Too much sun?","I know snake plants are sold as low light plant, but that means it's low light tolerant. Your snake plant seems very thirsty by the way the leaves look - they are shriveling. If it's by the windowsill (BTW, which direction is the window facing?), it is probably getting enough sunlight for the plant to use its water content faster than you think.

Water it well and make sure it drains well. Don't try to keep a watering schedule for your plant but rather look for signs to see if it's thirsty or not. You can look at the leaves (does it look like it's shriveling?) and feel it (does it feel soft but not mushy?) to check if needs water. Under watering is a thing, too.

What should I do about it?,"[Christmas cactus](https://www.grenebo.com/the-beautiful-christmas-cactus%ef%bc%9aan-ornamental-plant/#Pest_and_Disease_Control) is often affected by anthracnose, rots, and leaf blight, especially in high temperatures and humidity. Serious plants should be pulled out and burned. At the beginning of the disease, spray with 50% carbendazim wettable powder 500 times every 10-15 days, 3 times.  
  
If the damage is serious, the surface of the leafy stem is covered with white shells, which makes the plant grow weak and the damaged part is yellowish-white, if the damaged plant is light, it can be scraped off with bamboo slices, and in serious cases, it can be killed by spraying with 25% thiophanate-methyl emulsifier 800 times. In case of red spider damage, spray 1000-1500 times of oxymatrine solution to prevent and control."

I was recommended to wash in hydrogen peroxide and then root in water with air stone. Part of the stem has rot but isn’t squishy yet - any advice?","Rot on a plant is like cancer.  If you don't get every little bit (squishy or not), it will spread faster than you realize and you'll lose more plant in the long run than if you had gone scorched-earth at the beginning. 

You need to make sure there are clean margins at the cut area/s.  And yes, rinse with undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide. You may need to repeat this a few times until the fizzing stops and then repeat for a few days.

I suggest using generic bottled drinking water during the whole rooting process.  Read the label.  Be sure it's RO filtered and UV treated.  Minor bacteria in tap water...while okay for humans and healthy plants....will make this process more difficult on a plant that is already struggling. 

Good luck!"

I would repot in a much smaller pot with regular potting soil, mixed with at least 50% perlite to provide the drainage these plants need. They cannot sit in wet soil and as you mentioned, was over-watered when received.

Between it's poor traveling, a new location and repotting, it's stressed. I really hate to mention repotting again, but I would go with a much smaller, unglazed terracotta pot, with fresh potting soil and perlite as mentioned above, then only slightly sprayed to dampen the soil a little until it settles in.

Pots should only be large enough to contain the current root system, with a tiny bit of extra space."
309522,t3_tq3808,guys is this a spider mite infestation?

Which spider mites just love. In the early stages of an infestation you might not see the mites and it may just be the eggs that are visible. Webbing is often a sign of a more advanced infestation and I’ve found they don’t really web on calatheas, maybe because they’re already fluffy underneath. One clue is if the little dots are only on the underside of the leaves, along the stem and also in the crevices on the bottom of the leaves. That’s where they like to lay their eggs to keep them safe. In my opinion the leaf damage is also consistent with a spider mite infestation. I would inspect all the leaves with a magnifying glass or torch to see if you can spot any mites moving around. And maybe just treat anyway. I’m a newbie though so I might be wrong about some of this!"

They do not yet look large enough to support the plant. And after it's potted, lose the bag. If it needs more humidity, leave a glass of water next to it."

46805,t3_ez5xio,"Orange leaf on my new ficus elastica. I just bought this, over never owned one. What caused it, should I prune it, and how do I prevent more?","You can prune the leaf, it's basically dead. How many separate plants are cramped into this pot? It looks really densely packed, I'd pot 2 together max, better even only individual plants. They have more root space and the leaves can absorb more light. Hard to say what causes this one leaf to die, but it might be the space and fight for light, but it could be a lot of things. As long as it's only the one, I wouldn't worry. Also I'm not so sure misting actually helps the plant in terms of humidity (there's controversial opinions about it), I'd prefer a pebble tray."

Is it the after effect of damage done by ants or repotting in new soil effects.. please advise what should i do?,"I went through this a while back. Check the leaves for pests, I had a stromanthe triostar that got wrecked by scale because one of those automatic watering mechanisms had broken and released all of the water at once. 

Thankfully there was a drainage hole, but suddenly there was a ton of ants and I believe they were attracted to honeydew created by pests that had come in because of the wet soil."

- train it to grow upwards by staking it up
- give it more light

It’s thought that monstera develop splits to allow water and light to get to the lower leaves. Therefore they’re less likely to develop splits if they’re less than a couple of years old, grow horizontally, or don’t get a lot of light."

Mine was suffering from root rot and how I dealt with it was washing out the root ball to expose all of the roots. Then I cut away all of the mushy, black roots and put it in fresh well draining soil. I suggest cutting away mushy roots and placing it in water until the roots begin growing healthy, green/white roots. Good luck!"

Does she need more water? less light? or am I worrying about nothing?

I have more pics but I don't know how to upload them."
247759,t3_p0r1o3,Can I bottom water using mosquito bit tea? Will that be effective for getting rid of fungus gnat larvae?,"In short, yes-- but there are a few things to know. 

When done properly, bottom watering is still thorough enough to saturate the all-important soil layers where fungus gnat larvae will hatch and feed. It just doesn't soak the very top surface.

When starting your BTi treatment, you want to top-water, to ensure that all layers are fully populated with the good bacteria. It's not a contact kill. Larvae eat it during a certain stage of the gnat life cycle, and then they die, so they can't reproduce. BTi doesn't affect adults or other gnat stages, which explains both why it takes a while AND why it becomes a permanent solution if maintained. 

 If you make Bti part of your permanent care routine then it won't matter whether you top water or bottom water, because gnats will never be able to establish a population. This also gives you freedom in growing more delicate plants that need moist substrate and don't handle drought well.

Bottom watering is a perfectly good routine, but you should top water thoroughly at least a few times per year to flush any remaining salts and other leave behinds from plant foods and the normal substrate life cycle. Hope that helps -- happy growing!"

I’m worried the cold might be making it sick. Thoughts?","By the looks of the leaves and roots, your orchid appears underwatered. Is spraying water the only way you water it? What potting medium is it in?

I water my orchids that are in orchid bark every 1-2 weeks by filling their  pots with water and let it soak for 15-30 minutes. Then completely remove all the water being sure no pools of water remain. I also try to avoid getting pools of water in the crown and in between the leaves. In my experience, roots, crowns, and leaf joints are very susceptible to rot when in left in pools of water.

I would also avoid spraying the orchid as this could cause water droplets to accumulate and pool in the crown and leaf joints. I’d also remove it from the window as sunlight will dehydrate it even faster. 

To rehydrate, I’d recommend watering every other day for a week and then begin watering weekly with low amounts of fertilizer.

Good luck!"

You will want to use **new** well draining soil (if you reuse this pot make sure to clean it real well but I'd opt for a a smaller pot). Lay the cut strands on top of the new soil and then water it. I place it in a bright window and allow it to dry out. Eventually it rooted and started new growth. I'd dispose of whatever is left. Check for pests as well. 

If you don't want to prop I'd clean all the dead matter. Remove all shrivelled pearls. But normally root rot will spread so the best course of action is above."

Is the black part on the stem soft and mushy? If so, it's probably rot. You'll need to cut it all away with sterilized shears until you don't see anymore discoloration in the stem.

Even in a hot environment only giving them 5 days to dry out, is far too little. If they start to wrinkle before that, a good idea would be to check the roots and see if they're healthy? 😊

Cut healthy vegetation, leave to callous for 3-4 days, put on top of dry soil, and give it time. Misting is not good for succulents as they will burn because of the water magnifying the sun rays.

30102,t3_d7rz2e,Snake plant leaves are curling and starting to look like skinny tubes. I’ve had it for about a year. First noticed the curling in July but it seems to have got worse since then. North facing window so lots of bright light. Water biweekly-ish. Never been re-potted. Does anyone know what’s going on?,"It might be getting watered too frequently. How dry is the soil when you do water? I like to let my snake plants dry to a desert level, and then some, before I water. Since it's not been repotted before, it's probably worth doing to check out the roots (make sure there's no rot) and give it some fresh soil. And now that we are entering fall (at list on this hemisphere, not sure where you are!) the plant won't need as much water as it did during spring and summer. 

The other thing to consider is pests. You can take a magnifying glass to the plant and its soil to check for creepy crawlies, or you can try shaking the leaves of the plant over a bright white surface and see if any bugs come off. If it is pests, fresh soil will help, and you can begin looking into treatments like neem oil to defeat the bugs."

70990,t3_gi7kh9,Many of the leaves on our Alocasia California have turned white and some also have yellow/brown bits. Does anyone have a diagnosis for this poor patient?,"We first noticed the leaves turning white maybe 5 days ago but we're not sure when it first appeared.

We bought this plant in a hardware store about 2 weeks ago and have kept it since in a pot outdoors on a balcony in Northern Germany. The weather was low 20s (Celcius) and sunny until very recently and it was probably in full sun from late morning onwards for most of the time we've had it. Is it possible that we've damaged the plant by exposing it to too much sun?

It was watered a little every day if the soil didn't feel moist. I took it out of the pot to check the roots and they looked fine. I think it needs a bigger pot though.

I honestly have no idea what I'm doing so I'm very grateful for any suggestions. I've checked for any visible insects and can't see any. The white stuff doesn't wipe off; it appears that the leaves have turned white, and some have yellow/brown bits too. The new leaves growing at the bottom look relatively healthy.

It should never be in full sun or you'll kill it, it should be in bright indirect light and can be in a little darkness and the yellowing is most likely from overwatering it, only water when the top inch has dried out, these are kind of semi succulent so they can go without water for a little while (not like succulents though just thought I'd emphasise that)"

I’d probably trim the whole thing back closer to the pot, so it’s easier to work with. Cut up the vines into 4-6” sections. Water prop the ones with leaves. Bury the sections with no leaves in some new, clean potting soil and keep damp but not soaking. 


Then take the main plant out of the pot and shake off all the soil. Give the roots a rinse in clean water. Then inspect the root system for anything diseased, discolored, or mushy and rotten. 

Before you replant it, wash the pot well and consider giving it a dip into a mild bleach solution to kill any unhealthy bacteria that might be clinging to the clay.  Then repot the plant in new, clean potting soil and give it some time to recover.  When you have some roots growing on the water propped leaves, plant a few into the pot with the old plant to thicken up the top. It’ll make the whole plant seem more full and healthier."

As other have said, there's no saving it and your best hope is propogation now. u/Madame-Ziggy's advice is solid.

For the future, succulents only need watering every few weeks to months. For most succulents you can tell if they need water because they will go wrinkly and soft (no colour change). If a succulent has enoguh water, its leaves will be nice a plump. If you're ever unsure if you should water, always leave it 2 days and see.

242514,t3_orj7u8,Help with transition to soil. Got this plant in leca and would like to plant it in soil now. Also have some brown spots on leaves! Any advice for the transition? Soil composition tips? Pot size recommendation?,"Why not just create a soiless medium instead rather than transitioning it to soil? I only ask because the plant may go into shock and the roots may rot since it will be placed in a new medium and will have to create soil roots. If you plan to transition to soil I would water your plant with rooting hormone concentrate that's diluted with water when your plant needs watering. This will help your plant work on pushing out new roots quicker that can adapt to it's new medium and prevent shock. Also when transitioning do not rub the roots, they have tiny root hairs and if they are damaged the plant will go into shock. 

Your soiless medium mix can be customed to your liking. Ex) you can mix lava rock, pumice, bark, and coco coir. You can add the leca that's attached to the roots as well. You can also buy bags that have it already premixed."

I know you saw a brown leaf 🍂 which makes most of us plant parents nervous but really—more often than not—I have found that I have to get accustomed to healthy plants( like this pretty lady) going through their own process of life and death. Which for
them means yellowing, browning, then dropping. As long as there isn’t a dramatic and sudden systemic leaf drop problem and multiple leaves aren’t dying simultaneously, you are likely ok.

Miracle grow has small bags of each. I would definitely use all three if you want to go that route though! take a hair pin and pin the nodes where the stem meets the leaves close to the dirt.  And water really lightly around the roots and the leaves but not a lot. Place the pot in the container, put a small bowl or shot glass or something full of water in the container with it. (Snap on the lid to the container of choice) And place it somewhere that gets a lot of indirect light.

Then spray the plant top to bottom with a spray consisting of 25% isopropyl alcohol, a few drops of dish soap, and room temp tap water. Spray every leaf, every stem, top and bottom, until the whole plant is dripping wet.

Check for more bugs and spray top to bottom every single day for at least a week or 2 until you're absolutely positive they're gone.

Add hydrogen peroxide to your water for the next few weeks as well as they can also make nests in the roots.

If so, your plant isn't going to be happy and essentially needs to regrow ""water"" roots (""water"" roots can be successfully transferred to soil if they aren't super old).

What you can do here is coil all of that bare vine in water and hopefully the nodes will develop ""water"" roots.  Once they are 1-2 inches long you can transfer  back to soil (bury the whole vine).

You can spray with a copper based fungicide and hope that it’s fungal. I haven’t seen any reports of a good antibacterial treatment for houseplants.

Unfortunately, I had to cut all of the infected leaves off from my plants that showed signs of infection — even a tiny dot. That was the only way to stop the spread. It was fairly devastating to many of my collection.

To ensure your plan is healthy as possible while fending off the disease, make sure you’re fertilizing appropriately and keeping the space well ventilated — I bought a few tiny fans for areas with poor circulation.

Get some neem oil, several clean rags, and go to town. Probably haul all of them to the shower (or outdoors, if that’s an option) and give them a good soaking with water and then wipe them down with neem.

It is my understanding that during your scale removal there was damage done to the cactus. 

Did you apply sulfur or another antifungal to the wounds? If not then likely that is the culprit. You can try anti-fungal treatments now if its still early but there is a chance you may have to cut it out if it gets worse and starts to spread.

If it gets worse and you do go the surgery route, be very clean with any cutting tools or any other tools you use to break the skin of a cactus.

It may be throwing a fit, but it can still come back. They like a lot of light, and good consistent watering. Brown on new leaves would most likely be edema from inconsistent watering, but brown on the bottom leaves could be general plant stress freak out, or possibly from pests.

I’ve been giving him plenty of water and humidity since the yellow/brown spots started. What do I do??,"That soil mixture looks good, but I have a feeling that pot is way too big. It also looks like a pot without drainage, which is very likely to cause root problems sooner or later. If you've given it a lot of water in a pot without drainage, it might have been overwatered. 

I'd get the plant out of the soil so I could check the roots. If there's anything dead or dying there, cut it off. 

Repot into a smaller pot with drainage holes. The pot should be just a little bit bigger than the root ball, or you'll risk overwatering. If you don't have a pot handy, maybe you've got like an empty yoghurt container or something? Anything plastic that is roughly the right size will do, as long as you can poke a bunch of holes in the bottom. Place the draining pot inside that white pot if you want. :) I'd put leca or rocks in the bottom of the white pot, and then put the plastic pot on top of that, like a booster seat. Water thoroughly when dry. Don't leave standing water in the pot.

Snake plants require very little water - I watered mine about a month and a half ago and it’s still good to go for a while. It’s possible too that your potting mix isn’t well draining and retained too much water if you didn’t water frequently.

It's an odd plant. Have one your size, along with one miniature that lives in a terrarium. The one in the terrarium keeps its leaves for many months (loves the humidity, but NOT excessive watering or roots will rot), while the large one grows erratically, like yours. 

 They cannot tolerate direct light, but do need some decent lighting. Dappled light seems to work best. 

Looking at yours, the pot is likely too large for the plant. If you keep Arrowheads in an appropriate size pot (**slightly** larger than the entire root system), stems will remain shorter, giving the plant a fuller look.

You can also cut back at least 1/3 of the root system when repotting in a smaller pot."

Please give him something much, much bigger to stand in. As tall as the plant is tall and about as wide as the main body is a good rule of thumb. That's a thick stem, probably with a tap root that is all curled up at the bottom suffocating. You should gently loosen and uncurl it if you can without damaging in the process of up-potting."
141765,t3_jkv6dd,"Why is my polka dot plant doing this?? Lower leaves falls off every week (2-3 of them), and the rest is drooping and curling. But it keeps growing taller and sprouting new small leaves at the top. Is this a problem, and how can I save it?","*cracks knuckles* alright, here we go.

Polka Dots are mega dramatic but I'm glad i saw this post because I didnt understand them at one point too.

Heres (pretty much) everything you need to know about these guys:

They're mega fucking dramatic, meaning, they like lots of water. But dont overwater obviously. If your polka dot wants water, it will do what is called ""fainting"". Its leaves basically get all limp and the whole plant just looks flimsy and dead

Do NOT worry. This is normal and its super easy to fix. Just give it water and it will literally perk right back up in a few hours.

As for the dead leaves, i really wouldnt worry too much, i currently have two polka dots that occasionally will lose a leaf or two, its no big deal and should be fine. If you are really concerned, just give the dead leaf a little tug when its ready to come off and throw it away.

Also i noticed your polka dot is very leggy, if you want it to be bushy and nice, all you have to do is take your fingers or some clippers or something and prune the leggy parts, BUT make sure you clip right above a node so you leave a little node at the top for a chance to grow new leaves. This way, it will retain a nice bushy and full shape. If you need pics or anything of like a demonstration dm me and i will help.

And one last thing, since these guys like so much water, it is important that their pot has a drainage hole.

That will be all :)"

But today when I went to check on it, it came right out of the soil and majority of the roots were dead ): I repotted it since there were a few good roots left. What did I do wrong??","Root rot. If all of the the roots are black and mushy, say goodbye. Sorry Kiddo.

Aloe, a succulent as I'm sure you know, likes to be dry. 

Here's the plan for next time:

Plant all your succulents in cactus or gritty mix, in terracotta pots w/ drainage holes (glazed porcelain and plastic are not porous enough), without gravel or anything else at the the bottom (contrary to popular belief, a ""drainage layer"" actually *increases* the probability of wet feet by raising the perched water table of the potting medium).

Do not water your succulents on a fixed schedule; water them on *their* schedule, and always soak them until water comes out the drainage hole. How to read their schedule? Two good ways - water when the potting medium is completely dry all the way down (you can use a moisture meter if you want). Alternatively, wait for your succulent's chubby leaves to start getting a bit wrinkly, as that means it is thirsty. If the leaves get bumpy or blistery [or sometimes dark spots], it is swollen with too much water (this is called edema), so let it dry out thoroughly and water less often.

Happy succulents here you come!"

If you don't like the leggy look of it now, you could trim the long parts and propagate the trimmings then plant them in with the rest of the plants to make it bushier!

The current one you have might even be too big. With the size of the plant you could probably keep it in the same pot for a few years depending on the growth speed (with yearly soil changes of course). 

Basically the only time a plant needs repotting is when the root system doesn't fit in the current pot properly."

I'd just suggest you keep the soil somewhat moist (not soggy or completely bone dry)"

344098,t3_wej0tm,My Christmas cactus has been looking very sad lately! I’ve been giving it lots of water (once every 2 weeks) and full sun but it still looks sad :( Any advice?,"Schlumbergera prefer **partial shade** rather than any direct sunlight. Get it out of the sun. They also prefer humidity - it is a tropical plant, that requires more humidity and a little more watering than regular succulents.

Remember, Schlumbergera prefer being rootbound, so only use an unglazed terracotta pot (with drainage, of course) that is just large enough to contain the root system with a smidgen of space to spare.

I suggest pulling out of the pot to check the roots. If there are any black or mushy roots, remove them. If you have a woody stem, I suggest scraping the part that is BELOW the soil line, lightly with a very sharp knife, to expose some green. This will help establish new roots.

**This is the dormant season for a Christmas Cactus, so it needs very little light during this time** ***and*** **requires a period of darkness before blooming again.**

I would also suggest pruning the long leggy branches back. You can plant all cuttings, so there is no loss. When you cut, cut exactly at the junction between segments. The cut portion should produce a set of 2 leaves where you cut one. This helps the plant stay bushy, rather than long and leggy."

38540,t3_e3ir5i,"I've been pruning leaves on my monstera as they develop brown and yellow bordered spots, worried she's just slowly dying, thoughts?","I have a few thoughts... First, you need to change the way that this is staked. Please remove the twine that is holding the stalks to the moss pole. The way that it is now prevents proper ventilation around the stalks. If anything, only secure a few to the pole. The way that it is now could definitely be contributing to the issue. 

Stop misting. I have a long spiel about the various negative aspects of misting, but the important one here is that it promotes the spread of many diseases, including those fungal and bacterial in nature. I suspect that you may have a fungal issue. 

Providing proper ventilation and taking misting out of the picture should help. I suggest also taking a look at the roots to be certain that there's no rot or other issues there. 

Once this is resolved, I suggest trimming the remaining leafless stalks closer to the base as that's where any new growth will appear. Best of luck!

Edit: I wouldn't water until the soil is almost completely dry. Three inches isn't quite enough."

Of you want to keep it a bonsai, you will probably need to trim the roots if it is root bound. I would recommend looking up a YouTube video for this. Bonsai need a lot of maintenance to keep them small. If you don’t mind it growing larger, Olsen the roots and pot it into a bigger pot.

Root rot is harder to address. Remove all the damaged roots you can find, and repot with a well draining soil. A lot of times the soil they come in is not very good. Take care not to over water."

It's been doing fine and growing quite a lot. A few leaves yellowed and were lost in the process due to low light at the back side of the plant I guess, but nothing I ever seriously worried about.

A few weeks back I noticed that there was mold on the top soil and it seemed to be too wet to me. So I thought, fair enough, I didn't know too much about plants back when I got this one and made some mistakes. I'll just repot it and do better in the future.

Now I've reported it around Easter and had to cut some roots off due to mold. I feel so embarrassed and sad, but on top of that I lost grip on a major part of the roots in the reporting process (the tiny small ones, none of the 'bigger'/stronger roots tough). So a fair amount of the smaller roots of the plants root system fell down and got torn off.

Since I've reporter the plant (~2 weeks ago) the dropping of the lower leaves is getting worse and moving upward. Also, the yellow leaves you can see only appeared after reporting.

I love this plant dearly and really really want to keep it from dying. What can I do to help it? Was the damage done during reporting already too big? Should I cut the upper parts in the worst case to put them in water and encourage new root growth? I'd really like to avoid this scenario, but this is my emergency strategy as of now. Any less drastic ideas? Thanks a bunch in advance for any kind of help and tipps!"

Did you recently fertilize? You may be keeping this plant too moist. Too much moisture will harm the plant.

I would personally discourage the use of a plastic pot inside this pot. Terracotta is very beneficial to the plant because it helps moisture evaporate more quickly. Putting a non-permeable pot inside it negates that."

Fast forward about 3 months and it looks pretty sad :( the leaves are curled over and they don’t seem to be growing at all. Any ideas on why/how to make it healthy again?,"Pot is way to big, soil is to dense for Pothos. Airy loomy soil and a smaller pot that drains well. If the roots are rotted away, restart your water propagation and gather the above materials for repotting. Pothos do need bright indirect light to thrive. Fertilize with a diluted fertilizer once you repot so you do burn the roots. A high nitrogen fertilize is best for growth. Don’t use a water schedule, test the soil by pushing a finger a few inch down to see if it’s dry, once dry, water. Water is used and evaporates at different intervals depending on the conditions of the room the plant is in."

After falling off, the part where it was connected to the stem dried and turned black. Now the stems segments are falling off... the plant has brown lines on the stems. Disease? Too much water?","I see a thin layer of white powder on your leaves. If it's not normal dust (which it doesn't look like it) it may be fungal. My kalanchoe had something similar. Eventually a white mildew fungus (powdery mildew?) Started spreading from leaf to leaf.

Or do you just adhere to a schedule?

I would recommend if you do the last one (Schedule) you reconsider and rely more on touch, especially reaching deeper into the soil with your finger to get a more accurate sense of how damp the soil still is (how dry the very top is is often a poor sign of how much water really exists in the soil deeper down.)

Do these roots look dead to you? Should I remove them and only save the healthiest part of the plant or can I leave it like this?,The roots are fine. You could go up a pot size. Not too much larger of a pot

Brought it inside when it started getting cold, watered it once, and it DIED. Dropped all its leaves and the trunk went soft.

Then i left it in a corner for months and it grew a whole new shoot while i wasn't looking. I give it one drop of water and it DIED AGAIN

So water it no more than like, once a year lol"
64863,t3_g6w5ew,"I re-potted my Monstera because it got root rot from the self watering planters, now it looks like this. What can I do to make it happier?",The pot is far too big for the plant size so it’s gonna hold too much water and risks the chance of rot again. I would mix pumice and moss into your soil with a smaller pot.
368445,t3_yn1pry,My bird of paradise plant started browning from the tip of leaves 😭 does anyone know why or how I can help her?,Mine is the same. Could be tap water. Could be lack of humidity. Could be under watered. Could be a range of things so I gave up worrying about it.
87546,t3_hdl1kr,I rescued this guy from my local walmart. Gave him a hair cut. I think he has root rot :( what do i do?,"I highly recommend that you consult r/savagegarden. They're the experts in carnivorous plants. Plus, if I'm not mistaken, you need to have VFTs sitting in a saucer of water since they're bog plants. They need to be quite moist, not soggy.

306601,t3_tfp9tk,How do you tell the difference between mealybugs and whiteflies? Or maybe these are neither… Alcohol? Neem?,"Those look like mealy bugs to me, but I've never dealt with whiteflies. I had an orchid with mealy bugs, I swabbed the ones I could see with rubbing alcohol using qtips then sprayed with neem, let dry completely and rinsed under the shower (all my plants are in LECA so the water just runs through), sprayed with Captain Jack's dead bug brew, let dry completely, and rinsed again. I repeated this about once a week for 2 months or so before I completely stopped seeing them. But, with the orchid there were lots of crevices they could hide in. If you spray with most bug sprays it's a good idea to keep the plant in a dark location until it dries as many will cause sunburn if left in light while it's wet. I may have gone a little over the top with my treatment, but it worked and the plant didn't suffer any damage from it."
18678,t3_ca9pob,"Is this white stuff on my alocasia frydek something I should worry about? Doesn’t appear to be a pest; no webs, no critters, but I treat with neem oil anyway. Whatever it is is on all 4 leaves. Could it be dryness from low humidity?","I find these plants with large leaves, especially alocasia and caladium, get spider mites so easily even when none of my other plants get it. I would give the leaves a bath and spray if after it dries off to be safe. Way easier to be on the safe side here than wait and see if it progresses into a full blown infestation!\\

Edit: just saw your comment about doing the above already. In that case, you’re probably good to just monitor every few days or so and repeat if needed!"

370076,t3_yt7f25,Got this sunburnt rubber tree on clearance about a month ago and it’s given me 4 new leaves. I watered and fertilized it and now a few days later this happens.

145273,t3_jr0c74,I ordered this aglaonema pink moon and I’ve never had a plant that refuses to thrive more than this one. Does the pattern in which the leaf dies look like something diagnosable or is this just the acclimating process?,"These guys get bright indirect light and maybe some morning light. It originally arrived in a 6in container with like 5 plants stuffed inside and I planned on letting it acclimate before I split them up. They all continued to drop leaves like this for like 2 weeks so I decided to unpot it and look at the roots. The roots are good, stems are healthy, and I split them all up so they have room to grow. The leaves are still dropping like flies though! I’ve never had an aglaonema be difficult like this as I have ordered them before. Any recommendations would be appreciated!"

We mist him once a day and let soil dry out between waterings. Any ideas on whats wrong?,"Mine also took a while to start growing after I got it, until the weather got warmer. It also had some brow leafs, so I moved it to a spot with less direct sunlight and it got better. This is my first time having one so just trying to figure out the best way to take care of it. 
Now it is happy and growing, but maybe these plants take a while to adapt?"
317267,t3_udbvgk,"I received this inch plant as cuttings from a friend. It seems determined to climb upwards, but can't bear its own weight anymore. Should I train it to climb?

What are the brown spots tho?","Hopefully another redittor can provide more details, but in my experience, perfect begonia leaves are hard to come by due to how they unfurl.

That said, I had a lot more of those when I rescued mine from an overwatering staff at the hardware store. I had to treat the soil with organocide and repot for it to improve.

Edited to add: of course if you start cutting out the brown parts, then the cutout itself will brown."

Could anyone tell me how to revive it?,"Hi, I just got this plant from someone online (I think it's a dracaena). She has recently repotted it to try and bring it back to life but it keeps dropping leaves. I think she may have put it in a pot that's too large?

67268,t3_gb9bd8,what is wrong with my plant? i've seen so many photos of people growing hoya kerrii with lots of these hearts but i've had this plant for quite some time and it's still the same. any tips?,"Unfortunately, many people/companies sell these guys as cuttings with out any stem attached. With out any stem attached, the leaf will not grow anything new. It can live on it's own with out a stem for a period of time (I have seen anywhere from a few months to a couple of years). This is likely the situation with your guy. It is really a crappy thing for sellers to sell them like this. At worst, just enjoy your cute guy until he eventually dies, or at best, there still could be a slight bit of stem in there with him and it is just taking a long time for him to grow it out. You wont really know until he either dies, or grows more."
282183,t3_rbq79z,Yucca in bad shape. Watered and fed back in June and has died slowly. Tried intermittently watering since. Is this a lost cause?,"First off, yuccas are outdoors plants. Many people keep them indoors and manage to make them thrive, but in their natural habitat they thrive under hot, blazing sun. Also, they hate wet feet. You should allow the soil to dry out completely, even for a few days/a week before you water again. Even if you feel like you let the soil dry out completely, it takes longer to dry out at the bottom, so you can stick your fingers in the drainage holes to feel the soil. What could help is planting it in a terra cotta pot and use perlite, bark, clay pebbles or other draining materials.

Also, if you can put it outdoors but you are worried it might suffer cold damage, here in Italy (range from zone 8 to zone 9), they are everywhere outdoors and survived snow, temperatures until -7°C and more)"

249125,t3_p357du,Why does my mother of millions stretch so much? At this point is it okay to allow it to grow on a trellis?,"This is a serious case of etiolation, it's stretching out because it's searching for light.

They can die in a day if exposed to too much heat/sun with not enough water.
313015,t3_u14mnp,Came back from holiday to find my ficus tree leaves turning yellow and covered with these little white flies! Any idea what these are and how to get rid of them?,If it is indoors I would take it outside to treat it. Spray it down with water and then use some insecticidal soap to kill the pest.

I have a money plant which is propagating in water too. It is quite common to have certain stem area turn brown. However, I would suggest changing the water every two-three days. 
If the stem is too mushy, you can cut the excess rotting/brown part off. However, the roots should be fine. Just keep changing the water."

204985,t3_mw1uye,There is some sandy red things under a single leaf of my monstera for about two weeks. I wipe it off but accumulates again. What should I do?,"Without a close-up, I would guess that this is rust. 

It’s a fungus, and those red spots are it’s spores. 
The best thing to do is cut off the infected leaves and watch the rest of it closely. 

The spores will spread in the air or tiny splashes of water and infect more of the plant and any other nearby. 
You can try using an organic spray like neem, or a plain old fungicide. I would spray the soil, too.

Your fruit flies could actually be fungus gnats, you can wait longer between watering to the soil dry out. That’ll help cull the next generation, since the eggs dry out easily."

How much sun does it get? It does like more than 4-5 hours of bright light and humidity and shouldn't sit in direct sunlight. It likes bright shade also, and they do best in South or West facing windows. You will know when it has too little sun (the space between leaves is larger).

Remove brown and dying leaves from your house plants as soon as possible, but only if they're more than 50 percent damaged. Cutting off these leaves allows the remaining healthy foliage to receive more nutrients. Cutting them off will also tell the plant it's time to focus on growing more instead of trying to keep the dying ones alive."

I mean, sure. There are sprays you could use that would kill every bug around. But you destroy the native ecosystem by doing so. So are these guys causing problems? Or do you just not like them hopping around?

Looks like maybe leafhoppers, which don't tend to do a lot of damage as a general rule, even though they're plant-eaters. They usually prefer grass &amp; trees, not vegetable-garden plants. You could probably *reduce* them by keeping your grass shorter - they like long grass to hide in. But they have a role in the ecosystem...so if you don't HAVE to get rid of them, I wouldn't."

Is there something wrong or anything I can do to help her grow evenly?","Mother piece might have been especially tall because it was etiolated and reaching for light. 

But snake plants are /very/ slow growing plants. 

This looks like too much pot / soil for this baby. Snake plants prefer to be a bit rootbound. You can also run into problems because snake plants prefer to be drier, and more soil takes longer to dry. Ideally, there should be 1-2 inches of soil between the plant and the rim of the pot."

Should I cut the broken bits off?,"Sadly the broken bits won’t recover, so your best bet is to cut them off. However you can stick those broken bits either in soil or in water to try and propagate them (I’m unsure if you need to give it a clean cut though). You can also cut the tips of the broken leaves to a taper to match the shape of the good leaves.

49078,t3_f6190i,Am I killing my Monstera?? I water it weekly but I’ve recently realised that the water goes straight through and the soil dries quicker. How can I save it?,"Okay so there are several things that could be happening. The very first step you need to take is to remove the plant from the pot and look at the roots and the soil.

If the roots are super crowded and the soil is hard- soak the whole business in the sink or another large receptacle of water to soften it, break up the mass and repot in a slightly larger pot with fresh soil. By slightly larger I mean if your monstera is in an 8in pot, go to a 10in. Not a big jump in size.

If the soil is muddy and sludgy and the roots are black, you’ve got root rot! Rinse all the dirt away from the roots and remove the rotten ones. Healthy roots are white and firm. Hopefully there will be enough healthy roots to save the plant. 

The ideal soil for monstera is a chunky, well draining soil. Although they live in rainforests, their habit is to grow up the side of trees, so they don’t really like to sit with wet feet. Look for a potting soil with LOTS of perlite in it, and I do mean LOTS. Most people also add orchid bark to the soil to give it a looser texture. If you don’t have a moisture meter I would probably get one, water when the moisture meter reads about 3 with the probe stuck nice and deep in the soil. 

Good luck!"

Monstera and chinese evergreen do need more water so my advice would be to take the sanseveria out of the pot and placing it in a pot of its own. If you decide to do that you can check if the roots are healthy looking and if yes, just plant it. If not, you might want to take a cutting and trying to propagate it in moist soil, since it's not guaranteed that the plant will survive if it suffers from root rot."

60657,t3_fyij4g,Why is my bonsai tree only growing on half of the tree? I water it once a week when the soil drys out from the bottom up. It sits in a south facing window. I even pruned it a month ago but still no new growth on the right side of the tree. What can I do to promote new growth on the right side?,As far as i know you just have to be patient plants sometimes just do their own thing.

I’m debating on whether I should clean her roots off for Leca or repot her in soil. Would it possibly be too much stress to clean the roots now?,"I’ve never owned a bird of paradise or messed with leca. Maybe this will help get some exposure for you. I would stick her in a pot. Idk how long she’s been sitting out in the air/dirt like that, but probs not a fan.

Is this a nutrient problem or sun problem?","The pic on the right looks like a real nice and healthy leaf. Pothos do get these light spots naturally, there are some cultivars that actually are bred to display this trait more extremely but if its just a little, then it's because it doesn't get much light."

I saw leaves at the bottom had holes is that bad?,That looks a lot like burdock to me. You don’t want to help that grow. It’s a nasty weed that will get sticky/pokey pods (that stick to EVERYTHING) and spread more weeds into your yard.

204034,t3_muaedt,"HELP! Bought this calathea about a month ago, I mist it twice a week but leaves are curling up and turning yellow. What should I do?","Stop misting. It needs steady humidity in the air, not water droplets on the leaves for 5 minutes every few days.

If your air is dry you need to increase humidity somehow, either by putting it in a more humid room like a bathroom or kitchen, or ideally by using a humidifier. Their edges also crisp up from tap water, so use rain or distilled water to keep it happy

Yellowing makes me suspicious of watering habits though. How are you watering?"

Did I sunburn my poor Audrey?,"I haven't seen this before, so I could be wrong, but it's likely. Droplets on the surface of the leaves may magnify light and cause burns or discoloring. 

What are you treating it for? Certain pests affect the plant differently too so look into those as well."
58823,t3_fu8oql,"Just received my Monstera deliciosa cutting and the leave was snapped off when it arrived, Will the roots still grow in water without a leaf?",It should in theory! I've rooted pothos in water without leaves and just the nodes. (:

Advice?","Stick your finger in the soil and see if it’s dry or not. Depending on your location, humidity, etc it might need more water or less water. I wait until I stick my finger in the pot and it’s mostly dry. That’s what I’ve noticed with mine that the watering is the trouble makers when it comes to floppy leaves! Someone might have better advice though! Try not to schedule waterings but instead just check every couple of days with your finger! Plants don’t like schedules :)"

321951,t3_uppb4e,So I've had my Raven ZZ for probably a bit over a year now. It has a great rhizome and roots but has yet to have any new growth. The only thing is had done was loose the original leaf. Any idea why it hasn't grown at all?,"Did you give it plenty of light? Plants grow if they have excess of energy - and it is mostly light that they need. If your plant only gets that much energy to sustain its current size, it will not grow.
Many people consider zz a low light plant - but it only means they will not die of low light conditions, but in order to grow it still needs plenty of light.
My regular zz stands on the windowsill and it grew a lot in two months."

I slowed watering, I have always let it dry out completely and it’s in orchid bark/orchid box. New growth looks great. Thoughts??","Is that staghorn fern? They don't like to dry out between waterings. Like most ferns, they like humidity. Soil should always be damp but not too wet and if it's in a dry environment, they like being misted. Staghorn fern can absorb moisture through the leaves"

Is this normal/healthy?,"Yes, if you Google snake plant roots, you can check out the root system. The big thick things are rhizomes and the skinny ones are roots, if you have a super long rhizome maybe try and find a taller more narrow pot. If you're able to you can also sort of bend the roots a bit and stuff them in. Are the two plants connected by one rhizome or are they two separate plants? The other thing I would check is how many roots are coming off the 'big root', if many you should be fine if only a few put that guy into a nice sunny spot and let it do its thing for a bit.

They tend to grow bigger leaves if they can climb instead of hang, but its growth is definitely stunted even for a hanging adansonii. I'd first see if it's rootbound, and if it's not, maybe try to offer it a bit more light, and make sure you also fertilize enough to give it enough nutrients. What direction is the window facing?"
52171,t3_fee98m,"Hey everyone, I've been having this monstera deliciosa since last summer, at the beginning normal growth was very happy. I think I have damaged the root while repotting (I shouldn't have done it). Do you think that there is a chance of survival? Maybe propagation?","It's not a lack of sunlight! If anything it could be sunburn, but the damaged new leaf shouldn't be affected. Monstera can't stand direct sunlight, since it adapted to life at the bottom of dense jungles. If you put it in direct sunlight it will probably die, especially when already damaged. Not enough sunlight would manifest in smaller, elongates leaves, but that's not the case with yours. 

You either have root rot, or a fungal infection. Either way I'd cut the top to be safe. Dig it out, check the roots, cut anything rotting and let the damaged spot dry overnight, before repotting into fresh soil and a different pot. Don't reuse the old one! If it's a fungal infection it's full of spores. Fungicides are an option if the damage should come back. But my money is on damaged roots that need to be cleaned up.

Oh and after repotting watering should be increased slowly. If there's wet soil in spots without roots it can promote rot and/or fungi. But since you have a terracotta pot I don't think that's the case. Overwatered Monstera look very similar to yours - due to their damaged roots."

52081,t3_fe46go,"Anyone have any idea what this is? It’s on the soil in one of my potted cacti. I moved to a new place and noticed it after my first watering. The flash makes the soil look extra gross, but none of it really looks right. Should I repot the cactus in new soil?","It is behaving like a fungi, but looks like a bunch of insect eggs. I doubt it's insect eggs, but you never know. Lol!!

These roots weren't there. Should I leave her or repot her?","The dark part that feels like a twig is most definitely dead so you can try to prop the stems ore leaves. Just cut the stem a bit over the dead part and let it lay around for half a week and then poke it into moist soil or take the leaves that fall off or break some off and let them lay around for half a week before putting them on moist soil. While it doesn’t have a lot of roots/no roots you have to water it often, though you’ll have to watch that it doesn’t rot again because of the moisture. You let the parts lay around a bit because it’s basically an open wound and it has to callus a bit. 

This counts for all plants! Don’t give it a pot that’s too big or it will retain water for too long because the roots don’t reach everywhere which I think is what happened to your plant. It should also be in a pot with holes at the bottom so excessive water can flow out, you don’t need the second pot without holes though I understand esthetic reasons. I also recommend bottom watering, just stick the pot into water(not to the top of the soil), let it soak for a few minutes and let excessive water drip through the drainage holes(you can just put it in a sink/outside)then you can put it back. 

In your case it’s a succulent which means you only have to water when the leaves shrivel a bit.

It takes more time than a week and a half to recover. If you keep giving it lower/indirect light, water when the soil starts to dry out (but keep moist not soggy), and humidity (if possible), it should recover at some point.

Answered you in DETAIL here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/plantclinic/comments/u3qsmo/i\_have\_this\_pot\_of\_african\_violets\_and\_i\_water/](https://www.reddit.com/r/plantclinic/comments/u3qsmo/i_have_this_pot_of_african_violets_and_i_water/)

""Whoever gave you those instructions is INSANE! That will rot the roots in no time.

It is better to soak the pot in a small bowl of warm water (I use 16 oz plastic takeout containers) and let it sit until the top of the soil BEGINS to feel moist. Then DRAIN it thoroughly. I use old cotton towels to whisk away excess water after they finish dripping, letting them sit on the towel for a good 30 minutes.

You water ONLY when the soil is dry. Depending upon where you live, temperature, humidity, etc... that can be weeks. I soak my violets, approximately once every 15-20 days. That includes large African Violets, Miniature Violets, Micro-miniature Violets, Trailing Violets, Sinningia and Micro-Sinningia."""

That kind of growth hormone is really going to mess with your plant signals and microbial growth. It looks like a mold or fungus. The grey water is likely cellular death. Sometimes when a root system is not adequately developed the plant will stress and try to put out aerials to survive and get water anyway possible, especially if the root system is damaged. It looks like your plant is trying to save itself by growing more roots above the water line due to stem and taproot damage below.

Can someone please help?,"The only thing I may suggest, is to move the light further away from the top leaves. 

I'm going to give you my copy and paste response for fungus gnats:

PLEASE, do not waste your time and effort with any of the internet remedies, that normally do not eradicate the problem completely. Gnatrol will rid them in one application. No fuss, no muss. Mosquito bits are designed for mosquitos, not fungus gnats in houseplants. It is not the same as GNATROL, despite others who may argue the point.

THE most effective solution is to eradicate in the soil at the larvae level. You need to DRENCH the soil.

GNATROL WDG (Biological Larvicide): [https://nufarm.com/usturf/product/gnatrol-wdg/](https://nufarm.com/usturf/product/gnatrol-wdg/)

Gnatrol is 100% safe for all plants and all other insect life, except fungus gnats. Accidentally used 3 tablespoons instead of 3 teaspoons per gallon, on a row of succulents in my greenhouse and didn't harm a single leaf, but assuredly eradicated every single gnat.

I purchased neem oil off amazon and completely drenched the top/bottom/stems and soil. It has been 3 days and I cannot spot an alive spider mite. The eggs will continue to hatch and they will feed on the leaves with neem oil which will eventually kill them due to making their hormones go haywire.

366018,t3_ye3288,Monstera leaves curling -it was doing fine but I suspect exposure to soft but direct sunlight for an hour has caused damage. Is that possible or can it be something else? Will the leaves recover?,"Those lighter areas on the left (as I'm facing it) half of the leaf, especially the lowest section, do look like the beginning of sun scald. That leaf likely won't recover and might even continue to develop damage, just like with us when we sunburn - often we wake up the next day and the burn is worse. The entire plant though will be fine and even that leaf may be okay enough to keep. If the injury ends up fairly severe, just trim off those areas. 

Don't water more to try to help it. That's everyone's first instinct, but it's the exact opposite thing that's needed. A plant uses water when it makes food (photosynthesis), and since leaves are needed for that, the fewer leaves it has, the less photosynthesis going on, so the less water it needs. 

If you want to move something from one light situation to a completely different one, do it in stages. Move it part way there at first, to a spot that's brighter but not in direct sunlight. After a few days, move it closer/brighter. Once you get to the sunny spot, only let it sit in the direct sun for an hour or so, then move it back out - repeat every day, gradually increasing the time over a couple weeks. It's called ""hardening off""."

They can live in water, but it looks like it was not changed often enough and some sort of bacterial rot has set in. 

Honestly, I'd prop these, but not the yellow ones, they are dead. I would remove all brown or dying leaves, and cut them with a clean sharp pair of shears just above the roots. Throw the rotten roots away. I'd wash the base with a gentle dish soap, rinse well, and put them in a sterile vase of filtered water. (I'd also double the plant, cutting each stem in half, sealing the top with wax/super glue. The top will grow roots from the new bottom, and the bottom will put up new shoots.) 

I'd see if I could find a spot with a little more indirect sun, and change the water weekly, rinsing the base of the plants and the new roots well.  

You can also transition these to soil, which they like very much but it's a bit of process.

If the stem is completely dead and brown, cut it back about an inch from the base. New stem will pop out the base when it's ready.

If the stem still has a lot of green, you can cut about 1/2 inch above any green node, and a new stem (also a new baby plant, keiki) *can* pop out of the node. Doesn't always work, stem may keep dying back, no big deal.

This kind of wilting could be caused by underwatering, Schlumbergeras are not desert cacti so their watering needs are bit different than their full-sun cousins. 

However, in most cases with Schlumbergeras (and plants in general) problem is overwatering which is causing root rot which is causing plant being unable to bring moisture from soil to pads.

Check the roots."
7524,t3_b86e8n,What could be causing the yellow spots on these leaves? I recently noticed it had Mealy bugs on it but I cant really get rid of them since they are basically in between the leaves and the stems. The only way I can get them all out is by ripping the leaves off the stem. Should I toss?,"Spray it down really well with rubbing alcohol diluted 1:1 with water. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse it off. Once the leaves have dried, spray it with an insecticide or insecticidal soap. Repeat 2 more times at 1 week intervals. I would also use a systemic insecticide powder to prevent further infestations."

What can I try?","It's staying too wet, check the roots and be prepared to repot. Check it's not sitting in water. I'd go a size smaller on the pot but that's personal preference. Use a good violet soil with extra perlite.  The gray stuff's mold from someone getting the flowers wet. The orange is just minerals from the soil getting splashed around. Violets do better if watered by letting the pot sit in a dish of water for a few minutes, letting it drain and putting it back in the decorative pot."

Most advice said leave it alone so I haven’t done anything to it (2.5 wks) Stems are soft &amp; leaves are all falling off. Can I save it? Could tap water be the culprit?","stems being soft is a sign of overwatering (along with the extreme tipping). 

plus if it were underwatered, you’d likely still have little spurts of new growth at the top. also a good sign is its not defoliating bottom to top as a dry lyrata would tend to do.

I’m trying to get rid of all the soil.. for the time being can I stick my monsters into a vase of water and have it hang out there for a week?,"GET MOSQUITO BITS BT (it saved countless plant lives lol) , top water with a diluted mix of water and hydro peroxide, then for future feedings bottom water all plants and let them dry out more thoroughly before the next bottom water ! 

You could also try top dressing with neem cake but that seems to just be food for plants not a fungus gnat repellant, my case was really bad also and it took me like 3 months of many different methods to figure out which worked. The ACV trap didn’t work for me, the gnats rather liked the taste of my coco coir soil rather than take a dip in some ACV, DE(diatomaceous earth) works as a top layer only if you ONLY BOTTOM WATER so the top can stay at least somewhat dry and the DE can stay as long as possible. 

In the end, I also bought carnivorous plants and that seemed to really do the trick, my nepenthes ate the remaining adults for the fungus gnat problem, and also ate the little black house ant problem lol, so the best suggestion would be to hit em with as much different methods as you can, and hopefully they all die/leave 🤙🏽"

14566,t3_by5bws,The leaves on my peace lilly have brown tips and doesn’t seem to be flowering. How should I take care of my plant?,"**For flowering** make sure peace lilies get bright indirect light. They are touted as low light plants, and they are definitely troopers, but it will stop flowering. Even with best practices though it’s good to know flowering will always calm down after they adjust home because they are treated with a chemical to induce blooming.

**As far as the brown tips go,** I would increase watering. I use to water when droopy, but plant vigor has improved since I started watering when top part of the soil is dry. Another thing I would try is increasing humidity. If both of those don’t work, then it might be worth looking into filtering your water or using distilled. For me it’d be a last resort because I have 10 peace lilies and the lazies.

In the meantime, a little lpt for brown edges, cut them off at an angle that reflects the way the leaf is naturally shaped instead of straight across. It makes the plant look more groomed and the damage less noticeable."

247551,t3_p0gyfs,I’m in growing zone 6b: these rhododendrons were planted last summer. They’re in raised garden beds and are south facing. The summer has been very hot and somewhat dry. I have these watered via a timer for 12 minutes at 8pm. What can I do to help these?,"Ensure that the soil is acidic. The light green leaves make me think that the soil isn’t acidic enough. It’s a sign that the plant can’t take up enough iron due to the high pH of the soil. Add sulphur for long term soil acidity and a soil acidifier that acts instantly.

Ensure that the soil is moist all the time. Water only when the top 2 inches of soil is dry.

Fun fact: Blueberries, cranberries, azaleas and rhododendrons belong to the same family, Ericaceae, or the heathland plants. All grow in acidic, barren soils. That’s why fertilisers and plant food dedicated to azaleas and rhododendrons can also be used for blueberry bushes.

A tip: Water them with rainwater which is acidic. An alternative is 2 tablespoons of vinegar added to a gallon of water or 2 tablespoons of vinegar added to 4.5 litres of water. Try to add the exact amounts. The vinegar water solution has the same pH as rainwater. A stronger solution can be withstood by acid loving plants but it will scorch new growth. My tablespoon is 15mL and it’s the one used in baking. So probably don’t use a spoon used for eating."

Usually [chlorosis, or yellowing of leaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorosis) is due to overwatering; however, it could be due to age, disease, bacterial/fungal infections, too much sun/not enough sun, nutrient deficiency/nutrient toxicity, underwatering/overwatering, inappropriate soil pH, poor drainage, shallow/damaged roots, etc. As you can see, without eliminating the potential stresses one by one, the best anyone can give you is a well-intentioned guess.

Get this plant away from any others immediately while you verify what this is.  Hopefully it isn’t mosaic virus as it’s often recommended to get rid of the plant ASAP after mosaic virus is found.  If this is your only susceptible species you might try bagging and removing infected areas. Don’t compost anything from this plant or its soil if it is mosaic. Good luck!

Edit: Upon further research I found that bagging symptomatic leaves may not do anything even if done at first sign of symptoms. This is because the virus can be latent and spread throughout the entire plant before any one part starts showing symptoms."

I would more so rely on how the leaves feel (slightly squish them taco style) to see when they need water.
30705,t3_d9uaqh,I sprayed this plant with neem+castile soap+water a week ago and again today. After the spray dropped off I noticed all of these little white dots. Has anyone else had this happen? What are they?,"Looks like mealy bugs. 

Quarantine any plants that look like they have any white sacs (check thoroughly under leaves and at leaf bases). Rubbing alcohol will kill them on contact. I dip a q-tip in rubbing alcohol and go at it. After I get all the obvious bugs/egg sacs off with the q-tip, throughly spray (douse) the entire plant (under and over leaves, stem, top soil) with a 50/50% mixture of rubbing alcohol/water with a couple drops of dish soap. Keep it away from direct sunlight to prevent burning. 

Your neem oil spray might work too, but I personally haven’t found neem oil that great at getting rid of mealy bugs as compared to a rubbing alcohol mix.  Whatever you use, just make sure to do a daily spot removal check with an alcohol soaked q-tip and thoroughly spray for a couple weeks to ensure there are no more bugs/eggs."

30973,t3_dat4m1,"My cactus (echinopsis?) recently grew an extra bit out of its top after not doing anything for maybe 4 years, is it ok?","No he's not okay. This cacti is etiolated. This means  it's pushing out new growth as fast as it can and as skinny as it can to get to where theres actually light. Nearly all cacti need uninhibited direct sun for 6 to 8 or even more hours a day. I don't know where you are keeping the cacti now but he needs direct sun. That's why he's going all skinny like that. If he is in a shaded spot I'd say over the next 2 weeks, put him in a much brighter spot and then in a windowciel where there's direct sun in the second week. This make it easier for the cactus to get acclimated to taking direct sun. Hope this helps."

Between the weeds and the lack of mulch it's too hot to keep it watered correctly.

I moved him to a shader spot in the house since I thought he was getting too much sun?,"There are giant MEALYBUGS on the midrib and leaf stem of the first pothos photo. Separate these from other plants and treat with insecticides such as neem. You can also kill them with a dap of ethyl alcohol on a q tip. Where there is one there are many; babies present as ‘specks of dust’, or tiny round grey blobs, sometimes white. Adults are fuzzy white or striped gray. Their fuzz contains a wax that makes them somewhat hydrophobic so sprays like neem or alcohol help to dissolve it and dehydrate or kill them that way. Check all plants in the same room or vicinity, the nymphs travel very quickly to other plants. 

I agree with the other commenter that the pot is too large for the adansonii. It’s roots aren’t handling the water regiment well."

171441,t3_l69hkl,"i plant this orange plant from an actual orange seeds(on 27 nov)but I noticed its not growing a lot,i water it everyday and my temperature is between 26 and 14,so it it normal to grow this much ?","I have clementine seeds doing the same thing;  sprouted, grew a little bit, and then seems like they stalled out.  I would assume they are building roots under the soil to grow stronger before they put out any more leaves.   Watering every day is too much,  once a week more likely.

How often do you water, and how do you go about it?

Does the pot it's in have drainage holes?

What temperature does the room stay around at? Are there significant fluctuations in temperature in the room it's in?"
291182,t3_s5anxv,"Idk what type of plant this is, so i have no idea what needs it has. But ive found its very sensitiv to watering (i water it maybe once a month). Why are the leaves dying and falling off?","Thoroughly saturate the pot when you water until water comes out the bottom of the pot. Then only water again (thoroughly) when a finger stuck into the soil comes out dry. They also appreciate humidity and sunlight, so if you can add a pebble tray or humidifier nearby it will help. The spot you have it (on the far end of the couch) is likely not enough light for it. They also drop leaves when moved. They are sensitive to water but you are maybe not watering enough. I’m in NE US, have mine a few feet from south facing window and water everyone week/two weeks in the winter and more frequently in the summer."
124208,t3_iqk50s,Aloe was fine for several weeks. Two days ago some smaller pieces pulled apart easily. Tonight they all pulled away at the slightest touch.

Bugs that live in soil usually feed on something in the soil like dead plant matter or spores and mycelium and help breaking down the soil and keep mold in check. Ask r/springtail if those bugs are springtails, a very helpful bug to have in flower pots"

I water it fully till it comes out from drainage hole about every 3weeks. Is there a way for me to save my plant &amp; make it healthy again?,"You are probably watering it too much. It should like the bright light, but if you have normal potting mix in there, then it is probably holding on to too much moisture between watering. They hold so much water in their leaves that you don't really need to worry if the soil gets bone dry between watering."

Is it normal or I should be alarmed?,"Cacti tend to have shallow root systems, you can pull it out of the soil to check if they are healthy or not and just repot and water only when the soil is dried all the way out! It looks pretty dang healthy other than being wobbly :)"
291737,t3_s6m29s,so uh my bf brought this flf outside in ~5 °F weather and froze all the leaves. I’ve taken responsibility for recovery because the plant is obviously still alive; what’s the best way to help her out? should I chop the top half? or just treat kindly?,"You won't know about the FLF until it has a chance to recover. Keep it somewhere the roots can stay warm and give it enough water that it doesn't dry out but don't soak it. It won't use a lot of water until the leaves start regrowing so it'll be mostly waiting. Leave the leaves attached until they turn completely brown and/or dry. After that, as long as the stem stays firm it has a chance.  


I'm not sure you can salvage the bf though."

It looks rather dark and dense, which means that it cycles slowly from wet to dry. That jeopardizes root health because they stay moist too long. I would consider repotting to a mix that is better-draining."
172837,t3_l99jlq,Is this low level leaf shrivelling normal for a succulent that's growing taller (hence the stem) or have I killed it by leaving it on a South facing window sill over winter?,"Does that pot have a drainage hole? It looks a bit too big for an echeveria of that size so there might be a root rot problem. Also, how often do you water it? If the shrivelled leaves are hard it might be underwatering. It's very hard to give these too much light so unless there are burns I wouldn't suspect a light issue."

122229,t3_ing9s6,I am forever confused about this rubber plant I've had for maybe a month. Why is she so tiny with the skinniest branches and oddest colored non- variegated leaves? Anyone have thoughts?,"This can happen when the rubber tree Tineke isn't getting as much light as it needs. They need a lot of brightness because they cannot produce as much chlorophyll as their burgundy/dark green cousin. Your plant is turning green to be able to produce more chlorophyll and survive. A lot of direct sunlight will burn the leaves, so avoid long direct light exposure.

The green leaves are not reversible. It's even possible she could turn completely green and kinda look like a ficus Audrey."
122250,t3_inigs7,There's some kind of mold(?) under my peperomia argyreia. Is this from the eggshells or plant feed or am I doing something wrong? How do I fix it?,Thr mould itself is likely harmless but it is an indicator that the soil is holding too mucj moisture for too long. Either overwatering or shitty wanter retaining soil.

How do I prevent this in the future?","This looks like classic caterpillar damage to me, as would happen on my edible kale etc. The eggs hatch in to green caterpillars (often) that strip the leaves very quickly. They don't eat the thicker veiny bits hence the Skelton look. Here (UK) the most likely species is the cabbage white butterfly. Diatomaceous earth round the base won't help as the eggs are laid directly on the leaves. For my edible brassicas the only thing that really helps is nets to keep the butterflies off, which I'm afraid spoils the look somewhat."
266648,t3_q1c7hh,One of my plants had a massive spider mites problem I caught way too late. I’m worried about my other plants but want to get some pesticides for my indoor plants. Any recommendations?,You can get predator mites for these as they will eat spider mites. And not harm the plant.

It also retains a lot of water, so you should only really use it if you want the soil to be consistently moist. You'd want to add perlite or pumice instead, as well as some orchid bark. The chunkier the mixture, the better."

My regal shield only has a smaller leaf now because I moved recently in colder weather so it was the shock of that and we lost an older, dying leaf in the process. I read that elephant ears go dormant in the winter months so they'll slow or stop growing until spring? New dirt and some extra sun would probably help."

A lot of these plants aren’t in great shape because of the transport to the stores during the cold weather. I have one of these plants and I have the same spots.

I didn’t notice scale until a few months in the house, and it was about as bad as yours. 

Here’s what I did:

If it’s a well established plant, cut it all down to the healthiest stalks, no leaves left. Luckily mine had a good woody base, so I cut off everything green. Treat stalks with neem oil and/or insecticidal soap. Give it a good scrub and wash down with water. I also repotted after making sure all the scale was gone from the stalks.

It took a little bit, but mine grew back bigger and better. Might not work, but better than letting the scale get it all and possibly spread to other plants (thought the spread didn’t happen in my experience)"

When it starts to grow new leaves I'd cut a second stem back to about six inches.  
When the second starts to leaf out cut a third and so on.   
That way the plant always has leaves to provide it energy but the pruning will encourage a more bushy form.  You can root the tips if you want more plants, too. 
And you cut the stems at varying heights because it just looks better."

Should i just pot it and see what'll happen?","Looks like a variety of Tradescantia to me. Not sure which one. 

I find these guys root better in soil than water."
127466,t3_ivn2nj,I noticed that the stem of my bamboo plant became yellow and with this brown thing which i dont know what. Is this normal?,"No, it’s not normal and it’s rotting. You should change the water more frequently or use drinking water if your tap water is full of chlorine.
Now you also should proceed cutting off the rotten part and let it root from scratch ☺️"
289467,t3_s05qqz,Tiny white-ish bugs on one (visible) leaf of my monstera. Dreading to ask: what are they and how do I stop them?,"I think this looks like thrips, also monsteras are very susceptible to them. You have a few options available but first you should isolate it from your other plants. You can spray it down with insecticide, use a systemic if you have it available in your country, or both. Another good advice I’ve heard is to go over the leaves with a lint roller to manually remove as many bugs as possible before going in with chemicals. You’ll have to repeat treatment over the course of a few weeks."
289462,t3_s054jq,"I inherited these three plants and they are ALL struggling. A cat peed in one, hence the tinfoil. The one on the tall shelf was pushed off (twice...) and is just struggling. So a. What are they and b. How the heck do I help them!?","- 2 x Madagascar Dragon Tree, Dracaena marginata

120078,t3_ikjxau,"hey guys! this is my happy little swiss cheese plant ,, is he okay here? i’ve seen people use moss poles to encourage vertical growth as well as letting them hang in pots like this.. does it matter which i do?","I believe the leaves will grow larger if they're allowed to climb something, but if you like the look of a hanging plant I'm sure that'll be fine too. :) 

Looks like your soil is pretty dense, and there's a lot of it in that big pot.. I'm a little worried about the roots. Unless the root system on your plant is big enough to fill the pot, I'd definitely want to mix a whole lot of perlite in the soil. Actually, if it was up to me, I might even consider getting the plant into a smaller plastic nursery pot (in a well draining soil + perlite mix) and then put that pot in the hanging pot. It would greatly reduce the risk of overwatering and unhealthy roots. But this is all built on assumptions about environment and root size, so your setup might be perfectly good in your house. I just know it wouldn't work very well in mine. :)"
173233,t3_l9xrb2,Lighting for these guys? I'm repotting this and the pot is a little too big for the window bench in my room. Will they tolerate low lighting?,"I got this cordyline today and it doesn't have any issues surfacing yet, however I'd like to avoid any arising. I have an east (I think) facing window and the wall it's against is in that path of travel for the early morning light. Throughout the day it stays moderately bright in the room but I'm not sure if that's enough for this plant? I tried to get it on this bench ledge my window has below it but the pot's slightly too wide and the plant is tall enough that it'll disrupt the ones I've got hanging."
120063,t3_ikj7na,"Had high hopes of savings this Begonia that was heavily neglected at Lowe’s, but after 3 weeks I haven’t seen positive progress. I’ve fed it and I water it once a week. Is there any hope at this point?","Not looking good but check the base - if it's firm, there's still hope, if squishy, it's a gonner. Not sure of the right term, but iirc these guys grow from a rhizome, so checking the status of that can help you figure out what's going on!

I'm afraid I can't help in terms of care as have only had one and it didn't make it ☹️ Distilled/rainwater, and bottom water to avoid getting the leaves wet is the best I can do - hopefully someone else will chip in tho!"
177301,t3_lhtbfv,"the bottom of my monstera pot has weird white dust and stuff, but the leaves and stems themselves are fine. does it have spider mites?? or is it just random mold or something??",Looks like normal spider web residue to me.

110175,t3_i668ng,"Bought this snake plant awhile ago and it came with these cracks in its leaves, is this something to worry about?",I think it probably just got bumped around in shipping or at the store. Nothing to worry abt.

110242,t3_i69qgr,"Monstera help ! I purchased him at Costco and the pot seems to be too small for it, should I repot ? What type of soil should I purchase ?","I would unbunch it immediately. Whatever is going on here with it being tied up is going to stress the petioles and the foliage. Plus, it limits ventilation around the petioles and blocks light exposure."
110466,t3_i6nsy8,"I don't know what to do anymore.. basically all my plants have spider mites and I just can't get rid of it. I'm using azamax, captain Jack's, alcohol and soap, spraying every 3 days or sometimes every other day.. I've lost SO many plants. any advice?","First, I'm sorry you're struggling with this. I know it can be very disheartening and you're allowed to feel that way. Second, try to look at this as a war, not a battle (or, in clearer terms, as a process rather than an event). When your expectation is to totally eradicate pests from your home, that puts a lot of pressure on you! So if and when you're not able to accomplish that goal, the disappointment and frustration is so strong because it feels like you've totally failed. However, if we're able to reframe our goals into something a little more achievable, like ""population control"", seeing yet another mite doesn't have to make us feel like we've failed, because we've adjusted our expectations. I encourage you to look at all the things you are doing to manage the bugs and organize them into 'daily' and 'weekly' tasks: basically, choose what treatments to do every day and every week and make them part of your plant care routine, that you do regularly from now on. I know it's a lot and I know it seems annoying, but I promise it helps. Finally, there is no shame in starting over if it gets the point where you just can't deal with it anymore. Plants are supposed to bring joy and peace and wonder to those who care for them and if there comes a point at which the struggle completely covers up the joy, it's not worth it to continue in that way. Your heart and soul is more important, always, so make the choice that will best preserve your peace, whatever that may be."
110510,t3_i6p8gp,I noticed this white stuff in my monstera pot this morning. Does anyone know what it is and will it kill it? Am I going to have to report her?,"On the first pic you can see 3 insects  or it looks like  the quality isnt good .

110516,t3_i6pnxm,My friend's cat got into this Peperomia and it's slowly dying. What can I do to help it revive? Should I cut off the half-broken leaf?,The half broken leaf isn't hurting it I think. My cat got to my ginger and I still have a borlen leaf there. It's just slight gnawed but still green and crisp. Also I don't see how it could be dying due to a broken leaf are you sure it's not something else

Anything else I can do or things to look out for?,"May be too wet.  Bird's nest ferns like a dry out, with high humidity.  They're epiphytes, typically rain or cloud fed.  They're also less tolerant of cold, so depending on how step a difference with the draft...

I was thinking repot and fertilize, but not sure if she can handle the stress?","Oh goodness. I think I might trim all the leaves back so that the living roots can focus energy on regrowth. Soil looks really dry, so a good soaking watering, too. Maybe change soil in another week or so after it starts to regenerate. Do you know what caused the initial problem?"

Also, what treatment suggestions do you have for next steps?","That looks like fungal mycelium. Not an issue, and it can help break down soil components into usable nutrients for the plant :). You may even see some mushrooms pop up from the mulch if the mycelium is happy there!"
112062,t3_i8xkgs,"Help with Sansevieria please? Watered and moved to low-light area, then this happens to soil. Any suggestions?",Dog vomit slime mold. It's a fungus. Beneficial to the plant and won't harm you. It will start growing what looks like tiny yellow dicks so I scoop it out.

262745,t3_psqd2d,"She's been doing great for 6months, but I just noticed this darkening around the stem. Is it something to worry about?",Yes this looks concerning. I would check the roots. It could be root rot travelling up the stem.

I've found new growth on these plants grow from the stem of the existing leaves...which looks like what you have going on right now!
173268,t3_la05wq,"My tradescantia at first sight seems to be doing fine. However, upon closer inspection leaves underneath leaves are dying and Ive had to cut away a lot of them. Their stems were also thin threads instead of healthy. Normal behaviour?",They need a lot of light. I noticed mine does that when I move it away from the window. They get rid of leafs that get the least amount of light. Once i put it in a pretty much direct sun it was growing without any issues again.
177417,t3_li00wt,HELP! what is wrong with my Begonia maculata? I keep the humidity around it at 80% ish I don't think I'm over watering it I wait for it to dry out a somewhat before re-watering it. I do have it on a heating pad could that effect it. Would not enough light cause this? What am I doing wrong?,"I think this is a mild case of underwatering. They like their soil to stay damp and not dry out completely (but always avoid soaking, sopping wet—a pot with good drainage helps a lot). I wouldn’t be super worried, begonias are crazy resilient—it is definitely ok in this pot size right now, but would also be ok in a bigger one if you felt like repotting. Along with increasing the water intake a tinge, I’d  get it off the heating pad— my experience they actually like cooler temps. I have mine outside right now in temps between 40-65 degrees and it’s shooting out new leaves like crazy and is happy as can be. In the wild they go dormant in fall and drop leaves for the winter, so even if you lose a leaf or two don’t despair— I’ve seen these guys lose all their leaves and still recover once they recalibrate to new conditions."

107181,t3_i1wm8l,"Aglaonema Valentine has yellowing leaves, small little white bugs(?) but still developing many new shoots/otherwise happy?","The white bugs are probably spider mites. Thoroughly check each leaf and stem for the mites and wipe them off with water (on a cloth or other soft absorbent material) if you haven’t already done so. You have to remove all of them. Snip off the faded/wilted leaves at the base of their stems. Keep it separate from other plants. 

It’s possible you inadvertently injured a root when you removed it from the plastic support container. It is a delicate process to do that and I’ve hurt a few plants doing it myself. Regardless of cause, I promptly remove dead/dying leaves from the plant, and this seems to improve the overall health of the plant."

Lost a leaf. I transferred it to a way smaller pot so in hopes that the soil dries out. What am I doing wrong???",It looks okay to me. Yellow droopy leaves means you’re overwatering it. Only water it when you stick your finger in the soil and it’s dry and/or the leaves start to wrinkle.Mine is west facing and gets sun but it’s never direct. Make sure you turn it so it doesn’t grow crooked. (I’ve had mine for three years since it was a pup and has since sprouted a whole family)

Otherwise they might just be going through a little shock from the repotting. If she repotted them deeper in the soil than before, that could also be a big issue. 

It's worth asking if she fertilized recently as well. If not, I'd advise not to for the next few weeks.

Good news here is that if things continue to decline, she can just cut the tops off and they'll root out in either moist soil or water, and she can just create a new plant from her old one!"

I go about 10 days between waterings, only 'butt chug' it (rofl), and only when the soil is super dry. Keep it out of direct light; they like bright, indirect light. So maybe move to a N/S facing window. 
Have you repotted since buying? A lot of the time, they are over watered at the nursery. They also like to be root bound, so I would suggest repotting into the same sized pot. Gently knock all soil off the root ball and inspect for any unhealthy looking roots. Trim anything unhealthy looking with sterilized scissors and then repot into that similar sized container using soil that has been mixed with perlite or pumice. I put a layer of pebbles/perlite on the bottom to help drainage. She's definitely not close to death or anything, but a few changes should help her thrive! I love SOP so much!"

How long do you go between watering? I have found that mine are happy with a full soak every three weeks minimum. (I’m in the UK so it isn’t particularly hot). 

Either way, wait for the soil to dry out completely between watering and make sure it has good drainage. I have mine in plastic pots with drainage holes inside decorative terracotta and leave them out of the decorative pots for around 2 hours after watering.

It's unusual to see them on a *p. incana*, suggests to me that there may be enough that they are branching out from the plants they adore, which are plants with more tender green leaves.

I've never used spinosad or the like so can't advise but here are some other things I've found. Treat broadly, thrips get around, including other rooms amd floors. Look for tiny black specks under the leaves, that will help ID affected plants. Monitoring after treatment is key - I now keep ""sentinel"" plants distributed in my collection and check them regularly (so far so good).

146518,t3_jt7hjb,"Unfurled monstera leaf is turning brown. At first it was just the tip, now the leaf turning more brown. Any recommendations?","New growth can be really sensitive to changes in hydration--if you can scale back on watering (either by bottom-watering, watering a little less often, or watering more slowly) while new growth is forming, that might help. When leaves rapidly pull up more water than they can use during photosynthesis, some cells will burst ( this is called edema ) and that can lead to brown spots or brown, mushy sections.

My monstera did the same thing, so I switched to bottom watering (set it into a deep dish filled with an inch or two of water and let the soil and roots absorb water for \~30 minutes) and generally try not to mess with it while new leaves are forming, and that seems to be working for me."

Don't mist! A lot of people do that but calathea's are dramatic and almost always hate the misting watter on there leaves. 
To increase humidity if you do not have a humidifier yet or will not have de chance to have one is a pebble tray. I just got some pebbles out of my yard and put them on a try, then put the plant on top of that. Is will not do enough but it will do sometimes to keep here alive.

148047,t3_jvv51y,Please help - purchased a few days ago from an online seller and leaves are turning yellow around the edges. Came perfectly green and growing in leca. Can I save the leaf before it turns yellow?,"Yellowing leaves on monstera read as water stress to me. I don't have any experience with LECA, so I can't give recommendations on that. However, I have read that they absorb water, and so if all the medium is saturated, and you don't have water pooling at the bottom I suspect the medium moisture isn't the actual problem.

Those are very large leaves on a tiny little cutting (tiny in terms of stem length).  It looks like the seller may have taken an air layer of a mature plant, chopped it, potted it, and shipped it. Cuttings often have water stress issues. An underdeveloped root system can't supply water to mature leaves fast enough to keep them up. Some people refer to the symptoms resulting from this problem as ""shock"". 

All that to say, the plant may be dropping its oldest leaf to shore up resources while it develops its root system. Could you answer some questions to help be sure of a diagnosis?

1. how big is the root system? 
2. Did the seller mention their propagation method?
3. how often and how do you water?

If it does, it could just be plain overwatering. Honestly though I have not seen streaking in the middle of the leaves before while indoors! Mine only do it when they get too much direct sun. These guys are pretty good about surviving being dried out between waters. My best advice for them is if you aren't sure, give them an extra day or two before you water. 

When trying to figure out if the soil is dry or not, my best suggestion is to stick your finger about an inch into the dirt, just above a knuckle. If you're having to break the dirt apart just to do this, it's totally dry and probably needs a drink. If your finger comes back out with moist soil stuck to it, no need to water right away, just give it some time. The sweet spot for these (and your pothos too) is when there's no resistance in the dirt when you check, and your finger comes out dry. Some people recommend moisture meters but there is a lot of debate about how effective they really are. 

Best of luck on your plant journey!!! 🪴"

I didn’t water her as much as I used to the last few weeks and she was actually doing pretty well and got a lot bigger! Any tips what to do?,"Those are a whole lotta springtails! They are completely harmless to plants, and can actually be beneficial. They are a clean up crew and will eat rotting material and what not. They thrive in moist soil. 

With this many of them, it can be a sign of your plant being too wet. A way you could get rid of them is to let the dirt dry out before your next watering, but it probably won’t get rid of all of them. If it doesn’t, you can use an insecticide, but you do run the risk of harming the plant.

Edit: I recognized them right away because I’ve got a couple of small containers of them that I’m breeding them in (aka just feeding and letting them do their thing lol). I have a Crested Gecko that I did a bioactive tank for, so I put a lot in her tank to clean up rotting material, her waste, etc."

What do I do?","That looks like some kind of succulent. If it is, the soil is 100% too damp. I've found that you're much more likely to accidentally overwater right after potting up because now there's so much more soil. See if you can move it closer to direct light to let it dry faster. If you're nervous that will take too long, try scooping out some of the wet soil/repotting with a well draining cactus mix. 

For the future, try bottom watering with your succulents and cacti. You'll be much less likely to over water them and it will encourage deeper root growth."

Most of them show signs of thirst when they're ready to be watered - like wrinkling or getting softer &amp; easy to bend. And I think that generally the soil is dry for a bit before that happens. With that being said I think some people judge when the soil is dry under their soil covering by using something like a chopstick to poke down into the soil through the rocks. Either way, good luck!"

There’s a multitude of options depending on your location and what’s available. 

To start I would spray down the top of your soil with hydrogen peroxide to kill any white mold and then dust cinnamon on top to keep it at bay until the problems resolved. Removes the main attractor/food source and keeps it at bay. 

As for treatment you can use any of the following for all waterings. 
Liquid BTI (gnat &amp; larvae killer) 
Mosquito bits (make a tea with warm water in a bottle leave it to steep and use that to water. Putting the bits in a sachet made of old tights or empty tea bags if you can find them) 
Hydrogen peroxide (works well for me but I wouldn’t use it long term. Will degrade the soil over time it basically kills all bacteria good and bad over repetitive use which is why I use it to spray the top instead of a drench too often)"

Any suggestions?,"You might want to do some research into fungicides.  I know copper fungicide is generally effective for leaf surface problems, but it doesn't help with all of them.  Also, copper is one of the more toxic fungicides for everything that isn't a plant so it should be used sparingly.

Daily misting of leaves seems to be a very common practice among indoor gardeners, but this can increase the risk of disease and generally does not increase humidity for very long.  You may want to avoid wetting the leaves and invest in a humidifier if you are concerned about the humidity if your environment.

Good luck with your research and I hope your leaves recover."

You can give it a moss pole to wind around, or cut off the aerial root"

Is it possible my grow light is burning it?,"If you brought it home last night, it is more likely it was damaged in transit or in the shop. A new leaf on a plant in transit can quite often be damaged to the point of not opening fully, not anyone's fault, it is just too much stress for the plant. Leave it for a few weeks to see what happens, if it 'gets stuck' as is, you may need to wait for the next leaf to emerge, then trim the damaged one off."

165503,t3_kvw2wt,So I offered to repot my aunt’s decades old easter cactus for her and am now realizing that I may have bitten off more than I can chew. I have never repotted a plant as old or as big as this and was hoping to get some guidance. How would you guys assess the plants current condition?,"There is no way to handle this type plant without at least a *bit*  of breakage, so get your propagating stuff ready  :)   
Make sure she understands about the breakage.

That said, if you can have someone hold it in the air while you get the old pot off it will be of immense help in preventing breakage.   
Or do it alone with it lying on its side on a large table- you need to smish up the root ball a bit and open it up getting rid of the majority of the old soil. This will make a mess so be ready. Someone else holding it while you do this is easiest but a table will do if you must go it alone.    

**Have the new pot ready.** Have your premixed soil in the bottom and sides and gently set it into place.
You can then make a paper or plastic wide-mouthed funnel to help you get soil into any empty spaces- then just go slowly tamping in down with your fingers- it will be tedious and it will be slow.   
   
Some will still break but using a funnel sure helps.         
Then water it well and start cleaning up the mess. I lay tarps down, lol

Cut out all the dead and damaged stems while you're at it."

As in, same frequency of watering both summer and winter? If so, I'd guess it's been overwatered.

Also, the dry looking stem on the left looks like it’s dead. I’m a bit worried about root rot because the coco coir looks pretty wet. 

The yellowing is not a good sign on the main stem too. You should put it in a well aerated area in a bright indirect light spot. Stop watering it and check regularly.

I got this parlor palm in April because I heard it was relatively easy to care for and I’m just starting out with my plant collection. It was doing very well for the first few months, but this past month it has taken a turn for the worse. The palm initially sat about fifteen feet from an east-facing window where it received a good amount of natural light mixed with some indoor light. I watered it about once a week, usually enough to dampen the soil but occasionally more if it was drier 1-2” down.

In early June it started to fade and appeared to need some water and sun, according to the tips sheet I had received with the plant. It continued to fade after giving it some more water and moving it closer to the window. I may have also overwatered it and the pot doesn’t have a drainage hole, but I wanted to give it a couple weeks with its new location and watering schedule.

I still didn’t see improvement, so mid to late June I decided to repot it. I used the same pot but used fresh new potters soul and lava rocks at the bottom to help drainage. I also cleaned the pot out. It is a 4” ceramic pot, for reference.

Given the time between you getting the plant and this happening, I suspect it's just stress, and that it will drop this leaf.  Going from the nursery to a house and getting repotted (if you did that) is stressful for a plant and sometimes it'll drop a leaf from the stress."
87835,t3_hdzxif,"Dwarf jade plant drops 5-10 seemingly healthy leaves a day. I water only when dry, but she seems to always be dry recently. Is this normal?","So, first of all, this tree looks still healthy AF, so you’re likely acting early enough.

I don’t know about your exact watering schedule, but given that you don’t discover root rot, you might be *underwatering* it, at least that has been the problem for me. Portulacaria Afra has a growth phase from March to October and in that time needs more water than in winter (it still needs some water in winter usually). If it doesn’t get enough water, it will drop leaves rapidly, even seemingly normal ones. It might also drop branches which can turn wrinkly before dropping. 

How often do you water? Only when the entire pot feels light to lift aka dry through and through? That’s not enough water, definitely not in the growth phase. Water whenever the top inch of soil feels dry. Do not water super large amounts, only medium ones. Throw away excess water. 

For me, that currently means watering roughly twice a week (around every five days) with a moderate amount of water. The top inch is dry, but the core is still a bit (!) humid (not wet!). I water to moist, but not soaking wet soil.

In October, I’ll slowly cut back to once a week and once every ten days to two weeks depending how dry the soil gets and whether leaves start dropping. That‘s even though I can‘t afford a place where I can give it a proper winter break with no/almost no watering. Once I reach that point after several weeks somewhere around November, December, I’ll stay at once every approximately two weeks (or a bit less even - if the plant starts dropping leaves despite standing in a light standpoint and is not root rotten, but dry, it’s underwatered!) until March where I’ll slowly observe when the plant begins to drink more again, then slowly up the watering schedule again. 

Watering more in summer holds especially true if your room gets hot above 25-28 degrees Celsius or it‘s standing in the full summer sun - that‘s too much heat even for a succulent plant like this, and it will need a bit more water than usual in that case. My flat in summer is everywhere between 32-40 degrees celsius with a south south east facing window, room temps depending on the outside temperatures, and that’s why I need to water more during that time. 

I constantly underwatered my Portulacaria last year and it dropped all leaves but one and several branches (which got wrinkly and then dropped). It’s now much healthier when I started watering more. If you‘re unsure whether you‘re over- or underwatering, check the roots for rot. Cut away all rot If you find any and water less in that case. Otherwise it might be the case you need to water more.

It should be in succulent soil and have drainage holes in the pot in every case, because even if they’re kinda thirsty as succulents, they’re also just like every other succulent in that they don’t like constantly wet feet.

Portulacaria also can drop leaves if it‘s getting not enough sun - or too sunburnt. Mine (variegated) has been doing fine in a south south east window, but it‘s shaded from the scorching midday sun and is overall used to standing in that place year round, so has enough time to get used to more sun from spring to summer - and less sun from summer to autumn. How much light is yours getting?"

Should we return ?","I mean you could.. but it’s only been alittle over 2 weeks. They do need time and take a pretty hard hit changing environments. Also transportation will beat up leaves no matter how much you baby them. The roots look normal. As long as they didn’t feel squishy. Double check for bugs. Tiny tiny tiny bugs. Other than that, just give it some indirect sun.. and alittle humidity if you can and keep and eye on it"
307362,t3_ti4kwj,found this on my fiddle leaf fig. This was the only leaf affected. Can’t for the life of me see any bugs on it. Anyone recognize it?,Pretty sure that is thrips damage and after zooming in on the pic I believe I can see thrips larvae too.

It’ll take diligent neem oil treatment or insecticidal soap washes. Good luck!

Is there anything I should do to give him the best shot at survival?,100% potting soil might not be ideal. They like an airy mix that dries out in between watering. You can mix in orchid bark and perlite to your soil.
87287,t3_hdaqc0,Please help! I brought this donkey tail succulent home and it broke off the stem :( what can I do to save it?,This happens a lot with burros tails. I would just propagate all the leaves on the stem and have a dozen new plants.

87480,t3_hdhuyl,"My Dad gave me this aloe vera because it was dying. What can I do to save it? I was going to replace the soil, but will that just completely kill it?",Chances are if you try to repot it will die. It's already in bad shape and they don't do well with transplanting.

It was mostly good reviews but 4 of them said this. So I opened my bag outside just in case. Nothing flew out, but saw this... eggs?",I don't think you could see the fungus gnat eggs. Unless you have a microscope. I would say what you're looking at is perlite and fertilizer balls. That they put in most soils.
309710,t3_tqk5e0,"Does anyone know why the base of my succulent is turning brown? Is this root rot? If so, how can I save him?",Too much water or too much sun (or both). It should recover once you take the stressor away.

Aloe does well with bright light, does well in outdoor situations with warm winters. Your plant looks a little on the light deficient side as well. Although the plant can continue to grow in this condition it will remain smaller and more leggy/stretchy(also know as etiolated)."

80481,t3_gwzxow,Help! He’s stopped growing and doesn’t grow aerial roots anymore. I think I’ve killed him! He looks like this all the time. Any insights?,I’ve had him about 2 years. He got way out of hand and his roots went crazy so I trimmed it down and gave it some fresh soil as I haven’t been able to repot to a bigger pot due to lockdown. He has baby leaves that all have just suddenly stopped growing. I mist and water and he has decent indirect sunlight. He’s looked pretty sad for a long time now which is part of the reason why I tried to refresh him in the first place.

180652,t3_lo6tr2,Plant starting shrivelling up and there seem to be webs everywhere?? Should I be worried about my other plants?,"Ivy is a spider mites dream, always gets infested in my experience. Looking at this infestation, it’s very heavy, if I were you I would throw the plant. Spider mites can let the wind carry them to other plants and can also hitch hike on you or pets, so it is possible they have reached your other plants. Don’t worry though, they can be killed, just keep an eye out for them. The best way to spot them is the damage they leave: white spotting on the leaves. I always spot them because their webbing can be seen where the petiole meets the leaf. 

I have a ton of experience treating spider mites and the best cause of action for me is literally just dish soap and water. Grab a makeup or paint brush, dilute some dish soap in water and scrub the leaves with the brush. For plants that have a lot of small leaves I place in the bath or sink, fully submerged and drown the mites for an hour or so, it’s worked every time for me. 

A lot of people suggest neem oil, neem oil doesn’t really kill anything it just works as a preventative for future infestations because pests don’t like the very strong smell of it. Edit: As mentioned below, neem oil does work as a pesticide.

Good luck with your infestation, I hope you get rid of the buggers!

Edit: to prevent spider mites, shower your leaves often to get rid of any lone bugs. spider mites also hate wetness, they thrive in warm and dry climates, so keeping the temperature cool and the humidity high is a great idea. As I say, neem is a good preventative, so spraying a dilution of it over your plants weekly is a good idea to prevent it."

101237,t3_hv2lax,What’s going on with my plants? I’ve been getting fruitflies/some type of flies around my house. What can I do?,"They’re fungus gnats, ugh I hate them they’re so annoying 😂. They’re attracted to wet soil (and fungus). The best medicine to keep them at bay is neem oil. You can buy neem oil mixes (it needs to be diluted), or you can get 100% neem oil and make the solution yourself which is easy to do. This works as a preventative and helps work on tackling them. 

If you slap the pot and look under the leaves, and see a bunch of them crawling around, you might need to also grab yellow sticky traps (cheap on Amazon) to capture the adults, and the newly hatched bebés.

If you want to see death, and hear the bebés sizzle and burn, grab some hydrogen peroxide 3% and dilute it with water 1part HP 5 parts water. (Wait until your plant is dry so you’re not just feeding it more wet soil.) Then spray away. Instant kill. :)

I have all 3 on hand because I can’t stand gnats, but neem oil is the consistent preventative. Good luck! :)"

If you can take it off the pot and check for root bound I’d suggest
300111,t3_sve0rl,Is this from overwatering?? I would regularly assume this was underwatering based on the way its yellowing but this soil stays pretty moist (i don’t water it often because of this). could root rot do this?,"Cannot quite tell from the photo.. what is the white tiny spots? A spider mite colony?

The points on the upper leave look a bit like bacterial/ fungal if it‘s not spider mites. 

And the lowest leave could be a reaction to overwatering. 

I don‘t know, it‘s hard to tell. I‘d get the philo out of the pot, get rid of the soil, rinse it completely and check how the roots are doing as it stays so moist which is strange."

105618,t3_hzq66b,Having trouble with a few of my plants having browning tips. Spider plant all of the new growth dies pretty quick. Any suggestions. Both in a medium light and I water about once a week. Suggestions?,"That is not heat stress with the spider plant. It appears overwatered. With spider plants, you need to let the soil dry 100% prior to watering. However, you also have to watch for the foliage to fade in color and for the leaves to begin to fold in half lengthwise. These are sure signs that your plant is ready to be watered. I do not suggest watering it prior to seeing those signs. 

As well, it looks it could use more light, too. The lift of the foliage as well as offset production are both directly related to light exposure. When it's receiving enough light, the foliage will be suspended and not even touch the edge of the pot. For reference, I keep mine in an east window so that it receives direct light in the mornings. 

Also, avoid fluoride as that burns the tips of the foliage and can result in necrotic spotting, too. Best of luck."

As soon as I god rid of one, I found another that had spread to many of my plants!

Are you bringing new plants home often?
How are you treating this beauty?

None of my plants are touching - I make sure of that and check up regularly because lots like to grow closer to one another!

I water regularly depending on each of my plants’ needs!
If you’re afraid of over- and under watering, place it in a spot that fulfils its needs just enough : if it likes direct light, move it just a bit further away from the window and so on.
In my experience it’s more about avoiding than ridding !

I even have plants that I know have pest, but it’s hard for me to do anything right now so I treat them as I normally would and jump in when I finally get the energy to treat it

My dieffenbachia keeps getting spider mites though I’ve treated it what feels like a thousand times, it just keeps coming back. My theory is that it’s getting too much light. Either way, it’s alive and well and loved ..

Wishing you and you baby the best of luck!!

Peperomias don't need too much water- for me I bottom water weekly. 

Your pots are adorable, but do they have drainage? If they don't have drainage, it can be tough to figure out if they need water or if they have too much already, because any extra water may be just sitting in the dirt at the bottom"

It's so tall because it's reaching for more light. Succulents don't need to be watered much because they hold water in their leaves. It's why they are so plump. You should let the soil fully dry out in between watering. Dry all the way through, not just the top few inches."
313247,t3_u1nsfz,"My brother didn’t water his plant for a while and after bottom watering it, it’s not taking—can it be saved?","Bah. Don’t give up yet. Trim off the deadest looking leaves and put in good light. Maybe trim it all. Plants want to live, let it."
374420,t3_z95ycr,Brought a hydrangea inside for the winter since it was so smol. It has graced us with sooo many fungus gnats. And one of the leaves is starting to curl. What’s wrong with it?,"I think that pot is too big for the plant. If there is too much soil sitting around the plant, then it has a hard time drying out making it a literal breeding ground for fungus gnats. It also causes overwatering and root rot in plants. I recommend moving this to a much smaller pot with fresh soil. Generally you don't want to increase the pot size more than 2 inches each time you repot so you don't have the wet soil issue.

Remember that plants generally tolerate being underwatered better than being overwatered. Let your soil dry out more in between waterings or consider occasionally bottom watering to let the top layers of soil dry out. You should always check your soil with a hydrometer or your finger before you water. If the soil still feels wet/damp, hold off on watering again. 

While you have this plant indoors,  I highly recommend incorporating [mosquito bit/dunk tea](https://homegardenandhomestead.com/kill-fungus-gnats-naturally-with-bti/#:~:text=Make%20Mosquito%20Bits%20tea!,to%20immersing%20them%20in%20water.) into your watering regimen. Fungus gnats are closely related to mosquitos so the bit tea will build up in the soil and kill off the eggs and larvae that live there overtime. The mosquito bit tea takes a minute to start working so you will need to consistently use it for a few weeks. Once the fungus gnats are under control, remember to cycle the bit tea into your watering regiment every few weeks to keep them at bay. Keep using the yellow sticky traps to catch the flying adults"

It's a bridge for diseases to spread. Yellowing is usually over watering, but if you are sure it's not that it can be lack of light or nutrients, nitrogen to be specific. So think about the soil it is in, is it fresh soil from store, is it random dirt, does it have any kind of organic matter in it? If it's random diet, reused soil etc, might be the lack of nutrients. I would also check the root ball for rot just to be sure. But to me, the dirt looks very poor so my guess wouod be nutrients. But as I said, it might also be light.

I honestly forget about mine all the time lol and when I water it the soil is bone dry. Try watering only when the soil is completely dry like powder almost. Keep it in bright light and it should be okay.

I’d also chop off whatever is yellow or crispy/dying. It will help the plant put more energy In producing new growth rather than trying to keep the dying leaves alive of that makes sense"

277970,t3_qx931n,my peperomia pixie lime has this single brown droopy stalk. the rest of the plant is happy. i’ll likely have to prune it but any tips on why this is happening?,"Not a great picture of the stalk in question, but from what I can see, it looks like it's broken and in the process of rotting. 

If that's the case, you can cut well above and below the bad portion. Apply cinnamon to the cut on the stem remaining in the pot. Apply cinnamon to the section you cut off. Throw away the bad portion left over.

Place the cut stem in a container with damp sphagnum moss and a loose fitting lid. Place in a bright location but not direct sun. Remove the lid once or twice a day for fresh air.

And then wait. If things go according to plan, the cutting should grow roots and eventually you can plant it in the pot.

But I would wait until the roots grow roots.  No need to be in a hurry. Robust roots make for a better transition when potting. 

•

Check the stem to see if it's healthy. If not, remove it.
Periodically check the cutting to make sure there is no rot occurring."
311989,t3_ty3c5x,My short leaved aloe offset is growing kinda strangely. I can see that it’s a bit leggy but it also seems that there’s some new growth happening in the middle of the stem instead of only at the top. Is this normal?,"Yep, new growth can happen at these points. The plant will have branched growth at these locations.

Side note: Check on how moist the substrate is staying.  The bottom most leaf that has died has a dark patch that looks like it stayed in contact with moisture for too long and might be rotting. It's always good practice to remove dead/dried structures. Leaving them could help promote bacterial and fungus growth if they get and stay wet.

I would remove the decorative rocks and replace with something much smaller in size (like pea-size gravel) if you want to use a top-dressing.  Large rocks hold in too much moisture for too long of a period."
257716,t3_pj5n2s,My rhaphidophora tetrasperma cuttings are yellowing within 2 days of receiving them (bought online). Are they goners? The tradescantia zebrina cutting I got from the same package is also very wilted. I have lots of props on the same window that aren't yellowing. Are these saveable?,"For the raphidophora tetrasperma, the most common cause for yellowing leaves is overwatering. The plant should only be watered when the top 75% of the soil is dry, so not very often. As for the tradescantia zebrina, the issue is the same. For the zebrina, the top 50% of the soil needs to be dry when watering, so this one can be watered slightly more often. These plants definitely aren’t goners!"

283369,t3_rfhscb,"Home air purification/living areas.. repurposing grow tent inline fan and carbon &amp; hepa filter... good idea, or no? I have a few plants being kept indoor for the winter, and have been noticing dust, mold is terrible this time of year, would this work as a decent substitute for air purifying?","Hi! Winter is going harsh on humidity inside apartments and house that are properly ventilated and do not have any major troubles with water systems. You may experience dry hands/face/lips ect, discomfort after sleep in your nose or throat. Plants suffer too, especially placed near heaters. If you open your Window you will lower your relative humidity, at 0C/32F air stores only the average of 3g/m3 of water. At 20-25C inside you will likely be comfortable with at least 9-14g/m3, but you can't bring that from the street, only give away. 

This is where you most likely need the humidifiers for the winter season, handmade (like wet towels, sprayings, wetting floor) or the fancy ones sold. Your plants may need at least 40-90% humidity depending on their care options to reduce the stress during the wintertime, but as you can imagine humidity above 70% could be stressful too, creating mold in your ceiling and walls, so growboxes, plastic bottles or aquariums may be useful for plants.

Dust is general problem in cities, coming from the streets or even brought far away from deserts in Africa, inside plants can't do much with that, so seasonal spraying and flushing could be also useful for their photosyntheses. They do require carbon dioxide for growth though, so filtering all the carbon inside room (idk how good those carbon skirmishers) will leave them without precious C02. 

**To sum up: Probably the right option is to get the humidifiers, not expensive and fancy, single works well for medium sized room. Still open your windows to refresh the air a few times a day. Do some wet cleaning every day or whenever you feel like it to remove the excessive dust. Spray your plants as well.** 

The stated situation is for the regions with cold winters, it depends a lot on your building materials and the quality of isolation."

318233,t3_ufxrt6,My Monsterra has been through a period of too much sun and I just found out it has thrips (just sprayed it with insecticide). What should I do with the yellowing / browning leaves?,"Thrips are pretty hard to get rid of, you will probably need to treat it a few times over a couple weeks (or longer) before they are really gone. If you are using an actual pesticide it will be faster than the organic methods.

You can’t do anything to repair the brown leaves, they won’t turn green again. You can trim those bits off though, or just cut off the impacted leaves altogether. Once new growth comes in the older damage won’t be so noticeable."

All the leaves started dropping (second pic was after a few leaves had already dropped). Is there anything I can do to save it?,"I would say that one week without sun would not have caused this much damage. 

The stem looks like it's suffering from rot in the second picture (at the substrate level) and the first picture looks like it spread. This can happen very rapidly.

I see mesh in the pot which makes me think there is a drainage hole. The roots don't look great...they should be a light brown to white in color.

•

I would try and prop the top. There is a good chance it won't work, but its worth a try.  I've had bare stems (after I beheaded) that grew new leaves but the stem and roots were healthy.

I would cut off the top third of the plant or until you reach very healthy, firm tissue with perfect color....not a speak of brown and positively no squish.

Rinse this piece in 3% undiluted hydrogen peroxide. If it fizzes, repeat until it stops. Dry on a papertowel.  Dip the cut end in cinnamon powder. Let sit in a spot away from heat and direct sunrays. Both will prematurely dehydrate the section. 

The end needs to callous over...so I'm guessing to let it sit for at least a week...maybe longer. Then in a small pot, not clay...use a small plastic cup with a couple of drain holes...fill with a cactus mix amended with perlite or pumice (my preference). The mix should be 30 to 50% by volume of perlite. Pick out all the really large pieces from the cactus mix. I call these planks and boards. You don't want the tiny roots hitting an oversized object. Lightly moisten the mix. Fill the pot to the rim. Firm the mix. Make a little depression...maybe half-inch deep...place the nub cut-side down. Firm the soil around. Place in a brightly lit spot, no direct sunrays.  And wait.

Depending on how hot it is there, water very lightly in about five to seven days. I'm guessing in four to six weeks, if this is going to work, roots will start forming.  The bad thing, you don't want to unpot to check. This will set it back. The best you can do it move some soil away from the base to check if you can see anything.

If the prop shrivels, then that's it. You tried."

They can dry out very slightly (no more than 1"" of dry soil), but for the most part they will need to be kept evenly moist in well drained soil. Consistency is important, so if you forget to water for 2 weeks, it will not be forgiving. Insect damage (which I don't see from the pic) can also cause it.

The anthurium looks really dense and healthy, so you could consider splitting it into 2-3 plants and potting those directly. I feel like that \*could\* work if you have good potting soil (I have read anthuriums need better-draining soil than regular potting soil, e.g. add perlite and orchid bark) and can care for it well, but with the shock of losing so many roots I might just repot into a similar-sized pot just without an annoying lip like that.

Take your time and be sure not to neglect the stems and the back of the leaves. 

Then get a systemic spray as others have suggested and spray the front and back of all leaves + stems.

i recommend terracotta. you need drainage with succulents unless you know how to water them - and it’s just trial and error. knowing the weight when it’s wet vs dry. having the right conditions. i have a couple without drainage but i use a bamboo skewer to test for moisture, i have the pot in the sun, and i rotate it frequently, it’s a terracotta pot, and the temperature is right - all of this helps with drying the soil. your pot isn’t the greatest one to use even if it had drainage for a succulent because it’ll really keep the soil wet longer and make overwatering much easier. but yeah this is totally fixable! after a couple weeks you’ll have roots but i really wouldn’t start REALLY watering for a month or so. just keep it a little damp - and seriously. terracotta is your bff. after the roots are established (tug on them and if they don’t give - you got roots. i’d wait a month to do that though) you can water when the soil is dry. it depends on the temperature, humidity, pot size, soil."

The tiny speckles could be anything really. Possible thrips damage, but it's hard to say. If there's any stickiness, treat with a bug spray that works for thrips. Avoid anything oil-based on succulents, it damages the farina and can lead to poor drainage and root rot. Diatomaceous earth kills everything and succulents don't mind it - you can dust it thoroughly and then just blow it off with a fan or something. 

There's nothing here that indicates root rot at present. You'd expect to see squishy lower leaves, progressing quickly up the stem to take out the whole plant. If anything, it looks like you have some dry ends."

It’s been helpful for me to remember that they have a necessary cycle of living and dying too that varies from plant to plant (this Monstera adansonii has its own little personality). And that it’s normal for leaves to yellow and die. It doesn’t mean that you’ve done anything wrong. 💜From what I can see here, she looks really good. Others might have different input.

339293,t3_w0u3hu,"I propped this monstera from a huge one I had to give away in a move. It went into shock when I first moved it into dirt, and its two biggest leaves curled. I repotted, treated with urea. It has given me three new leaves since then but the first two remain curled. Should I cut them off? Leave them?","So it was water propped?

Curled leaves is the natural response of the plant to minimize moisture loss by reducing surface area exposed to the environment. The curled leaves I am assuming, are from the old plant that had a full root system to support them. The size of the new leaves is the plant indicating ""i have enough roots to only support leaves this size"".

The position the plant is in seems to be getting direct sun, altho you dont indicate when or for how long each day, putting further strain on its system. 

You could move it out of direct sun while it puts down more roots (like dont move it into the basement or anything - just out of the sun) the plant itself will decide if it can afford to keep the old leaves. Atm it is still using them to photosynthesize &amp; grow - so i hope you are giving it a hand by using some liquid fertilizer (i prefer to use a 1/4 strength mix so not to burn any roots) Personally I would NOT remove them yet &amp; trust that after a few million years of adaptation, the plant knows what to do.

Raising the humidity around the plant will also slightly lessen the stress. Dont mist with a bottle - that just breeds bacteria - but if you can, use a pebble tray &amp; water or an electric humidifier if that feels more your thing.

And would tje thrips be able to survive? Or should I just nuke the whole plant?",She is still in a relatively good shape. You need to find a thrips specific pesticide and treat the whole plant two or three times. Don’t lose time with neem oil or diy treatments. Cut off only the leaves that are damaged (yellow or brown) and you should be fine
334737,t3_vofjud,can anyone identify these beetles on my banana tree? I sprayed it with captain Jack's dead bug but they came back 5 min later. any suggestions????,"Japanese beetles.   You can treat the leaves to stave them off temporarily, but the only way to truly control them is to treat your soil and kill them while they're still in their larval (grub) stages.

The brown spots in your lawn are probably the grubs of these same beetles, eating away all the roots of your grass.

Beneficial nematodes added to the soil would probably be one of the more pet-friendly treatment options, which I'm assuming is important to you, given that you have fencing installed."

Any thoughts on what could be causing it and how to fix it?","Moss and succulents make terrible roommates. Remove the moss, let the soil dry out completely and stay dry for a few weeks between watering. The yellow translucent looking leaf is a sign of over watering"

Even a few minutes of outdoor sun can be too much for indoor plants, especially on a hot day with no breeze.  The injured leaves will not recover, though any that stay partly green still strengthen the plant.  You'll just have to wait for new healthy growth to improve the appearance."

No new growth, a couple of really sad looking leaves dropped but otherwise steady. Any advice?","Smaller pot, more humidity, don’t let it dry out as much. These really prefer to be a little more on the moist side - while still avoiding root rot! And they love humidity so I’d get it a humdinger or put it in the shower / bathroom if there is natural light. Smaller pot to allow for quicker drainage from the soil and to let you water more frequently."

If other leaves are starting to show symptoms assess your watering. Pick up the plant. Is it very light? Is the soil completely dried? If yes, bottom water it to give it a good soak.

297545,t3_sn7fmr,My very young mother of thousands just had her first babies show up… they are shooting roots so I’m not sure what to do. Do I wait until they’re bigger?,"Believe me, they get the name for a **very** valid reason. You do not need to do anything. They will fall off into the soil and root themselves.

I can't cut mine back fast enough. Started out like yours and I finally gave up on the little ones falling all over the place and put the plants in a 10 gallon terrarium and just let it grow wild. If you look at the bottom [left side of this photo](https://xenofontis.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/8/6/10862460/100-8175_orig.jpg), you can see part of its tank. It's about 3 years old. I water it about once every 6 weeks and let it take care of itself! 😊"
297782,t3_snx5vw,Stems and leaves of my Aglaonema turning brown after repot. Had a gnat infestation but I thought I fixed it. Damage from gnats? Root rot?,"Pot looks too big for the size of the aglaonema, which may result in over-watering. I give mine a thorough shower about once every 3 months - they are **very** drought resistant.

Mine is larger, in a larger pot and is an absolute breeding ground for fungus gnats. Have repotted, soaked in neem oil, safer soap and even used mosquito dunks broken up, soaked and applied.

As annoying as the gnats are, they've **never** damaged the plant itself. AS you can see in [this photo](https://imgur.com/a/kLaoyQa), I resorted to sticky sheets to control the problem and found it is THE best solution.

The tray it is sitting in is curved upward and since the gnats have an erratic flying pattern, 99% of them wind up stuck. Very few come from the top of the soil - most come out he bottom.

Don't over-water and use a fast draining soil - not one that retains moisture."

334915,t3_vp0jg1,"one of my hydrangeas gets these spots every year, what are they and how do i stop them from happening again?","You need to dig up the hydrangea, clean the roots by spraying them off with water.  Dig a bigger hole and put some fresh in-ground potting soil.  Make sure it is in a spot that gets enough sunlight and shade and isn't standing in water for long periods of time.  Before you replant it; spray the roots and plant with a hydrogen peroxide dilution of:

**1 cup water to 1 tablespoon 3% Hydrogen Peroxide**

**1 gallon water to 1 cup  3% Hydrogen Peroxide**

(make sure this is the % rate you are buying - some places sell 35%)

Replant.  You can continue to spray the leaves every few days with the dilution.  This should help to get it going again.

If you don't want to dig it up, (or can't) - then just spray leaves every few days with the dilution.  Don't spray in direct sunlight or really not days."

I'd trim back the old, dead foliage so it doesn't foster fungus and bacterial growth. Going forward, water as required and let it do its thing.  It's survived in the current conditions, I wouldn't change anything.

299994,t3_suyrxu,"A Walmart clearance save from a couple weeks back, should I separate these two or just leave em in the same pot? If so how do I go about separating?","It looks like both plants have some pretty healthy looking leaves or new growth presenting, so I don’t think you’d need to separate the plant. Also, unless, the roots are growing out the bottom of the pot I don’t see any reason to repot it. In saying that, i always find plants from the super market have super dense soil and tend to retain a lot of moisture. If you were planning to repot this guy, I’d suggest breaking up the soil from around the roots, i wouldn’t go to the extent of removing all the soil because it’s just such a LONG process. 

I’m not too sure what type of plant this is, so it might be worth doing some research into what plant it is to determine the best soil mix that would work for this plant. My go to site for buying soil is [soil ninja,](https://www.soil.ninja) my plants literally thrive when they’ve been given the correct soil mix! 

If you did go about separating the plants this would be quite a long process because you’ll have to remove most of the soil so you can see the roots. Just be gentle when doing this, you’re bound to loose a few roots, but you don’t want to be too rough with the plant. It would just be a case of removing majority of the soil from the roots and gently untangling them and then reporting both plants into separate pots! Hope this helps 🙂"

From personal experience with a yucca, I would cut at the nodes where the leaf stems meet the main trunk. I tried to prop the yucca by cutting the trunk, and it rotted in the water. If you choose to only take the green, unfortunately you're starting back from scratch, and it's going to take years to get a new trunk. However, you'll have 3-4 trees instead of just one.

Pick them off manually, either way.

Assassin bug nymphs don't usually stay in groups like this (for long), milkweed assassins would mostly target milkweeds and relatives (of which a cycad is about as far from being a milkweed as you can get). Leaf footed bugs are much more indiscriminate about what they lay eggs on and what they'll feed on. They also tend to have wider leg segments, which despite the poor photo quality, these appear to have.

Standard insecticides don't tend to work terribly well on leaf footed bugs (likely the same for assassin bugs), in my experience, so I personally wouldn't bother."

I emphasize **SPRAY**, because the concentrate is terrible. It's as thick as toothpaste, does not dissolve in water and clogs every sprayer.

**PLEASE, for the love of plants, do NOT use neem oil or alcohol. It's like taking a sledgehammer to pop a balloon, when a simple pin-prick will suffice.**

Anything else will be overkill. Safer is gentle on all plants, including succulents, which are the most susceptible to harsh sprays.

**Once every 3 days is too much and may start damaging the plants. Follow the directions on the bottles, which state once every 7-10 days.**

Before treating, shower all the plants down, one at a time, placing them on their side, if possible, to avoid anything falling into the soil. AFTER they are showered down, then treat with Safer.

Lightweight dry cleaning bags make excellent isolation tents. For larger plants, use gown size dry cleaning bags. Tie off the opening where the hanger goes through (a tray underneath is helpful in case of leaks). Roll the bag down, then place the plant over the knotted end. Pull the bag up slowly and THEN spray until the insecticide runs off the leaves.

Twist the top of the bag several times after treating. By twisting, some air will be trapped inside, which is what you want. Fold the excess over and tape it shut. Let the plants sit for 24 - 36 hours and keep **completely away** from the sun or any grow lights.

Afterwards, cut the top off, slide down the plastic and let the plants dry off before moving back to their normal spots."

The wrinkles and floppiness say it's thirsty, so I'd imagine either it needs more water volume or more frequently, OR the potting mix is too moisture retentive and when you water it's held around the roots for too long, causing damage so the roots are unable to uptake water.

Need more details on care and conditions to be able to narrow it down, though. When is the last time you watered? Do you drench the pot or give it smaller sips? What is that potting mix?"

For mites you need a miticide.

This is mainly caused by the plant receiving to much direct sun. Is your plant in a place where it is receiving a lot of direct sunlight?

The shoots of the plant are the water storage tanks for the plant. They store water for the plant and when the plant doesn't get enough water through the roots it uses the water in the shoots and they get thin.  Your plant's shoots are very thin, they should be plump and firm. 

How often and how do you water your plant? I see your plant is in a clay/terracotta pot. These pots absorb moisture from the soil and the soil dries out faster than it would in a plastic pot. Plants in these types of pots need watered more often. This factor and since it looks like your plant is in some very loose soil could require  you to water your plant more often."

The watering needs to come to a complete stop. You need to water it a little at a time and away from the mold. You’re going to need to repot and use fungicide. Natural anti fungal stuff can help too.

Unpot everything with a rotten stem and cut off the rot and keep cutting until when you look at (and inside) the stem, it's clean - no rot. Let it callus for a week on a table in indirect light, then you can repot. Terra cotta with drainage is best.

The only thing I did was repot in Black Gold Cactus and perlite (1:1 ratio) and reduced the water to maybe once a week since it was summer. Lowes was watering it every day in a sphagnum moss blend growing medium so it was damaging the roots. Most of the time this is why the leaves are yellow, fail to unfold or fenistrated leaves are slow to appear. I just cut one old stalk down at the base and waited for another to appear. Repeat until all old, yellow and diseased leaves are gone. 

Since the first recovery video was shot,  I have nine new leaves (fifteen fenestrated and healthy) and a new shoot coming through the soil. I have also upgraded to a 5 gallon equivalent air pot, integrated bark, charcoal and pumice back in with the gritty cactus mix. I also started staking it to a moss pole in October.

**AS ALWAYS: TAKE IPM VERY SERIOUSLY WITH EVERY PLANT**

I always recommend that houseplant and cannabis gardeners keep [spinosad](https://www.bonide.com/products/insect-control/view/255/captain-jacks-dead-bug-brew-rts)  (*Saccharopolyspora spinosa*) on hand as it is non-toxic, safe for consumable plants, and effective against aphids, caterpillars, leaf hoppers, leaf miners, mites, soft-bodied scale, thrips, etc. I also recommend [an 8 week systemic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BX1HKI/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_2a6NDb66QKMHW) to prevent most of the pests listed from coming back (spider mites excluded.) The systemic is **only rated for non-consumable plants, should only be used on exclusively indoor houseplants as it may impact beneficial insects like our beloved honeybees** and will need to be reapplied every eight weeks.

*I've had some concerned questions about the systemic's active ingredient and its toxicity. Imidacloprid is an
odorless analog of nicotine, a chemical used in the past for controlling aphids. Imidacloprid is of low
toxicity (used in flea collars) and is classified as a ""reduced risk alternative
pesticide.""*"

If those are roots I'm seeing winding around the edge of the soil, then it's also *desperately* in need of a repot. The soil also looks too dense and heavy, so there's the possibility that it's hanging on to too much water and there's the potential for root rot."

I actually once almost completely killed my diffenbachia but revived it by planting it in a terracotta pot, and using a mix of potting coil/cactus soil/perlite to increase the drainage. I only water when the soil is pretty dry which is about every other week due to the fast drying soil, and I have it a few feet away from a South East facing window!

I hope this helps! I really hate using plastic pots and glazed ceramics because they tend to lead to soggier soil! I now use exclusively terracotta pots.
Also, more mature plants tend to be a little more hardy. If this one quits on you, try to buy a more mature specimen, it may be more forgiving. However, I raised mine from a little baby and haven’t had issues with is since I resurrected it 5 years ago!

Good luck with your plant friend!"

It is not worth repotting over this (or treating chemically), you'll just end up stressing the plant out over a non-issue. There are spores all throughout the air, things like fungi in pots are unavoidable. If you find the plant starts to have difficulty, I would assess your watering habits. Soil fungi do not usually harm the plants but they like moist conditions and they may signify that the substrate is staying too moist. That said, if the plant is totally fine then your watering habits are also fine. Even if you let the pot dry out, it's not a guarantee that the fungi will go away."

I would remove anything mushy and pot it back up. They are succulent-like and don't like to be wet; they'll rot pretty easily of they're too wet for too long. A cacti and succulent potting mix works well for them, let them dry out between watering.

Once potted, give them bright, indirect light and just let them do their thing. When they need water, they tend to get dull/lose their waxy sheen and droop a little."

Can I fix this without taking the whole thing apart?","If the pot is glazed ceramic or plastic (anything other than plain terra cotta that can easily let excess moisture evaporate) it most likely will not dry out properly and keep rotting your plant's roots.   Especially with being potted up to a bigger pot, the plant doesn't have enough roots to soak up that excess moisture.  I would repot the pothos and I'd even let the roots breath out of soil for a day or so if they look soaked/rotted when you unpot.    It's a pain, but at least you're still playing with plants the whole time.

50676,t3_fajf8u,My aloe’s leaves are shriveling(?) it’s only the new ones but the old ones are fine somehow. What’s wrong with her?,"The problem with your plant is in the crooks (where the shoots come together) of the shoots (leaves). That soil and plant matter that is laying in the crooks can cause the shoots to rot off of the stem. You need to get all of the dirt and plant matter out of the crooks. I have had this same problem and found that using a flush bulb from an ear wax removal kit works good for removing soil from the crooks of shoots without damaging them. Just squeeze hard enough to remove the soil and plant matter, don't blast them with the water. There could be another reason for your shoots thinning so I will provide you with this information:

Aloe Vera are Succulents (plants that store water) and the shoots (leaves) of the plant are the water storage tanks for the plant. When the plant is getting enough water through the roots it stores water in the shoots making them plump and firm. When the plant does not get enough water through the roots it uses the stored water in the shoots and the get limp and thin. The two main reasons for the plant not getting enough water through the roots are under watering or a root problem. I am more leaning to this being under watering than a root problem."

I don’t know what to do or what I did wrong. Should I clip the pieces that are still green and try to propagate?,"Totally salvageable! Go ahead and trim the green parts off, make sure you don't have any of the squishy stuff so that the rot doesn't continue. You'll want to use a bit more soil. I like the miracle grow stuff, and mixed with the bark you have, it'll make a nice fast-draining soil for you. Make sure the pot you have them in has a drainage hole or at the very least a pretty good layer of rocks so that the dirt doesn't stay wet. Probably what got the little guys, root rot sucks. 

After letting the cuttings dry out for about a day or so you then want to go ahead and lay the cuttings in the dirt. I take small bits of wire and bend them in half and then kind of stake the pieces of the cuttings down. This helps with rooting, the more contact they have with the soil the better. After I stake them down, I sprinkle a thin layer of soil over them, and then tap the planter on my work surface to settle it around the cuttings. Spritz with some water to get them a bit of moisture. Keep that up for ~2-3 weeks.

After the roots are established, I prefer the flood/drought method of watering. It mimics the natural way succulents and cacti receive water. Basically I water my plants thoroughly until water is draining out the bottom and the leave them be for ~2 weeks or until I notice the top looks like, well, a dusty dry desert. The 2 weeks is just a guideline and it may be more or less depending on you local climate. Also we are just about hitting growing season and the plant may need water more often as it starts to grow more. Especially if you plan on getting them outside. 

Also, string of X plants can live in less sunny areas, but they tend to get stringy and the leaves aren't as big. If you have a place indoors the gets 3-4 house of direct sun and 5-6 of indirect that would be optimal. Or even a desk lamp with a plant bulb for 8-10 hours. 

I wish you luck in your plant rescue and may all your cuttings root!!!

145214,t3_jqwjj4,"I got this Calathea Triostar around two weeks ago. I’m afraid it is going to die soon. I used to most it in the beginning, but stopped after noticing leaf rot. Now I’m taking it to the shower with me. Is there anything I can do to help it stay alive and healthy?","Hi! I have one and he is doing well and throwing out new leaves all the time and is just overall a super low maintenance plant. The care can be tricky to get at first, but I think that the first step is noticing the issues right away.

I have my guy in a low-medium light corner since he’s in my shower room, but is located in a wall corner so he doesn’t get hit with the light. He also stays in there so he’s used to one location instead of having to adjust from being moved often, which these guys are known for doing. Try to find ways to increase the humidity where you have it or find a better location for it and try to avoid movement.

Where I live, tap water is fine for these guys, but if you use that and you notice those browning tips of the leaves, try to use rain or distilled water instead since they’re also known for being sensitive.

Finally, at least in my experience, they like their soil to be moist, but NOT wet. I have two of these guys, one in soil and one in LECA. It seems to enjoy LECA so that could be a transition you can make if you’re confident. If not, try to be conscious of your watering to avoid causing it any stress because these kinds of plants can basically die if you look at it differently than you usually do 😂"

These guys have pretty high light requirements, so near a window that gets at least some direct light a day is best. Water till it drains through, but only every 2-3 weeks. My favourite method of watering succulents/cactii is by weight, so once you've potted it up into it's new soil pick up the pot and feel how heavy it is before you water it, then give it a really good soaking and pick it up again so you can see the difference in weight between wet and dry.

31590,t3_dcx169,Leaves shedding like crazy from my string of hearts kokedama. It was withering a bit so I thought I’d leave it outside for a week to get more sun. Just checked in on this poor fella and the slightest movement causes so many leaves to fall!! Will it survive? What to do?,"This one grows from intermittent caudices on the vines. You can see some of the potato-like structures in this picture. That's where the roots tend to emerge from and where nutrients/water are stored. Caudices tend to not be buried completely or at least buried at a shallow depth. The roots emerging therefrom do the bulk of the ground penetration. I imagine they are susceptible to rot if encased in a moisture rich, oxygen poor medium. I'm guessing some of these occurring at the base of each vine are entirely within the kokedama ball which is beginning to retain too much moisture and causing some rot.

&amp;#x200B;

My recommendation:

1. Cut open the kokedama and inspect the roots and caudices at the base
2. Wash off all soil and moss, cut off any rotted roots, cut off any rotted parts of the caudices you find
3. Allow roots and caudices to dry for a few hours, dowse cuts in cinnamon where cut (antimicrobial/antifungal)
4. Replant in fast draining mix, succulent mix + perlite + some bark fines would be good. Don't water for a day or two.
5. Use a terracotta pot or something with plenty of aeration. Don't overpot, as this can cause water to linger in the medium longer than needed. Ceropegias are related to Hoyas and Dischidias, they like to dry out thoroughly between watering, but also enjoy ambient humidity and plenty of indirect light.

Lastly, if the roots appear t be shot to hell and things don't improve, take plenty of cuttings and start over. Cutting just above the caudices on the vine can be placed in shallow soil divots and allowed to root. Other cuttings can be partially place in water to root. Be sure to submerge at lease one node as that's where roots will emerge. Other people wind the cut fine on the soil and pin them down so there's good contact between the nodes and the soil. I haven't had much luck with that method. It works better for SoP imho.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a tough plant that only seems to give me trouble if I over water or sun scorch it. Yours will be fine after some tlc.

If I were you, I would cut away the soft part until the stem is firm and looks healthy, let the cut callous for a few hours and put it back in water again.

I’m wary about giving advice here because I know how sensitive FLF can be and I’ve never owned one, so you may want to look for more specific mite advice for this plant. On another plant (say, a monstera deliciosa) I would: 

Isolate!! Mites spread easily. Then take it into the shower, spray it down very thoroughly with soapy water (dish soap, Dr. Bronner’s, etc) until every inch is dripping. Then spray it under the shower head to rinse it completely. Don’t be shy - tops and bottoms of every leaf, every crack and crevice. Once it’s dry, I would spray it down with “Bon-Neem”, which is a combo pyrethrim-neem solution. Stinks a bit so I’d leave the plant in there with the fan on and door closed. You can also just use a neem spray or other horticultural oil (this is a preventative and also smothers any remaining eggs).

Then check the plants carefully every day for mites and webs. Spray down with Bon-neem (or whatever you chose above) again each week for 2-3 weeks. 

Repeat all this on plants that were very close, and check your entire collection for mites."

If you want to keep it, evaluate what plants you have and whether they're something you want in your collection (not necessarily how they're looking now, it's easy to say you don't want a plant when it isn't doing well, but how they'd look at their best). When I first started getting into plants, I bought basically anything I didn't have without really thinking about whether I wanted it in my collection long term. Once you figure out who you'd like to keep, give the rest away (people will absolutely take plants for free, even ones that need rehabbing - post on FB marketplace!) and focus your attention on the ones you really want. Figure out what you have, look up their care, and make the changes.

You said you're in Virginia, and winters can be really hard on plants. Maybe think about getting a grow light. Doesn't need to be fancy, just a clamp light with a 6500k grow bulb in it will work.

It sucks when your plants get pests and it can definitely make you just want to throw them away and be done with it and honestly maybe that's the best case scenario for you right now with your sick plants, assuming you don't have any that are very difficult to find/expensive. That way you can focus your attention on the ones you really like and try to get back to feeling good about the hobby."

Also make sure to wash you hands thoroughly after handling. They spread really easily."

170386,t3_l48n2x,My cactus started to shrivel and I’m not sure if it’s because of the season change or watering issues. One is completely dried and wrinkled and the other one arm is wrinkled. Any hope for recovery?,"Uh ohs.  That sounds under-watered Imo. It would be better to water from the bottom and let it soak up what it needs once a month.  I don’t think 2oz a month is enough from the top :/

Maybe it's too cold?",Too much food and it's locked out its uptake system?
164292,t3_ktqlix,Help!! Rescued this orchid because I felt bad for it but I’ve never cared for an orchid before! What’s happening?,"Yes, sunburned.  Don't be surprised if that leaf yellows and dries up.  Let it go by itself.  It will eventually drop off on its own.  Right now, it's still providing resources for the plant. 

Blossom spike needs to be cut off to save resources. Cinnamon applied to cut spike to reduce chance of infection. Clean your scissors with isopropyl alcohol first. 

Water from the root surface, NOT in the center of the leaves. Soak the medium well and then drain well...no standing water. It should be good for about a week depending on your growing environment. 

It needs to be repotted in a pot one size up with good drainage holes.  Plastic or ceramic with holes is fine. 

The medium...the simplest would be to purchase some phalaenopsis potting mix from your local big box store along with some orchid fertilizer used at half to one-quarter strength everytime you water.  When removing old media...don't tug on it if stuck to the roots, soak the roots and if it comes off, fine...if not, leave it and pot as usual. There looks to be sphagnum moss in the pot.  Look up under the base of the plant....there may be a ball of moss underneath there. Remove that.

Regarding dead roots, can't really tell well by looking at the picture. Dead...they will be brown, papery and extremely shriveled.  Dying roots will be black, soft, and mushy.  Healthy roots will be green or silvery-green turning green temporarily as the outer skin becomes hydrated. Some roots inside the pot depending on the medium may be whitish and/or tinted light brown from staining from the bark-medium.

When potting, don't set the plant too low in the pot. Lowest set of leaves should be above the medium. 

Purified or rainwater would be best or room temperature tap water that has been left to sit overnight. 

Bright, indirect light....probably two to three feet from an east-facing window works well for me. I have some also in a north-facing window."

If you cannot accomplish that, place it right near the humidifier so that it is getting the most benefit from it. Also, that is sort of a big pot for such a little guy. A lot of the time when a plant is building roots, they will lag on growth."

The watering needs are met (let water drain out from bottom) and I think it gets decent sun. Lower leaves look rough compared to others, too. Tips?",The lower leaves are the older leaves and will come off eventually.  I would just focus on the leaves that are growing in your care.  They look happy and healthy.  Since they are growing I would fertilize a little (weakly) and when the days grow even longer it should definitely pop off.

The leaves often get black on the edges, and they have recently started to look waxy and wilted since moving it into more sunlight. Any advice?","Peace Lilly’s are super sensitive to hard water (unfiltered tap water) and that’s likely what’s causing the browning tips. They also like bright indirect light so if its wilting after moving it into a brighter area, it may actually be too much light.

Edit: when you fertilized did you water first or make sure that the soil was moist? Fertilizing a plant with dry soil is an easy way to burn the roots."

The plant has been thriving but these spots have started to appear in the last 2 weeks. When looking closely I spotted tiny insects moving on top of the leaves... The newest growth also took a yellow-ish tint near the edges, contrary to the other leaves.

Any idea what these bugs might be and how to get rid of them?"

Should I cut and try to prop?,"It might be rot from being too wet at the nursery or from a mold it picked up there as well. You could cut it out with a sharp sterile knife and let it heal or peel off those leaves. Cinnamon and turmeric can be out on the raw cuts to help them stay sterile.

They should darken in time. It does sound like the soil is staying pretty moist though. It could be the soil holds too much moisture or the pot it's in does the same.

99267,t3_ht0kxa,Some of my older monstera leaves are gradually browning/yellowing. Other than that my plant is absolutely thriving and has 5 new leaves. Is it possibly getting sunburnt?,"This definitely isn't sunburn. Keep in mind that even if you aren't necessarily watering too often, if the soil isn't well enough draining and has a longer wet/dry cycle, there won't be enough oxygen for the roots to access and this will cause havoc similar to what's going on here. This is one of those situations where you need to inspect the roots, look for rot, and remedy that, if necessary. This provides the perfect opportunity to reevaluate the draining potential of your soil and, if necessary, upgrade to something more porous to decrease the wet/dry cycle. Another factor in this is light exposure. I read your comment about 10 feet from a SE window. Is that space usually brighter than what's depicted in the photo? I ask because in their natural habitat, *M. deliciosa* do get direct sun in either the mornings or late afternoons (if they're in a tree) or all day in some places. For reference, I keep mine in an east window or on an east balcony so that it gets direct sun in the mornings. (if you decide to include direct sun, increase it slowly over a few days.) 

Regarding another comment here... While *Monstera deliciosa* do have decreased watering needs in the winter, they don't go dormant except in places where they are invasive that experience cold enough weather. Monstera aren't a seasonal plant. For example, they can fruit year around. Anyhow, I just wanted to clarify that. :)

Best of luck, OP!"

I was also thinking of potting the smaller one and moving it to the back patio?","I prune it like other palms, cut bottom fronds when they show signs of aging. I think to minimize transplant shock if you want to move it wait until closer to the end of the growing season. My neighbor moved her sago palm from the ground into a large pot and it stayed healthy.

The fact that these are growing is a good sign that your monstera is happy and growing! Usually you should put a pole in and attach the roots to the pole so that the monstera will grow upwards but if you think they are unsightly, you can stick them back into the soil or just cut them off!

I typically cut the dead leaves away but left a few for people here to see. He’s given me a couple new pitchers in the past few weeks which is a good sign but still the problem with older leaves dying away. Do they like a little more shade?

76606,t3_gqvfae,"Got this herb grow kit, planted the seed about 2 months ago. Anybody know why they're not growing quicker?

I've taken it out of the dirt and these are the roots, it looks pretty healthy to me so what should I do next?","They do look pretty healthy, the soil looks dry though. Monstera doesnt like longer periods of drought and will start wilting if a drought occurs. What i would suggest is repot it and give it some water! If possible in a planter with drainage so you dont overwater it.

A personal preference is that if one of my plants is not feeling well, i try to propagate 1 or a few babys (depends on how well the plant responds to propagation). This as kind of an insurance that even if the main plant dies, you still own a smaller plant where you can try again to grow it. Monstera is really easy to propagate so 1 should be enough to get this ""insurance"".

Good luck to you, hope it recovers soon! Have a good day :)"

Earlier on you needed to cut off all the brown/black roots up until the healthy white roots and replant in new soil and do not overwater. The root rot however has taken over the entirely of the root system and your plant WILL die. At this point sorry to say your own real hope here is to take healthy cuttings from your current plant and propagate new roots in a cup of water with the plant receiving indirect sunlight. Change the water when you see any green growth as that would be algae and wash it off as the new roots would be compromised by algae as it would kill it. Best of luck and sorry for the set back. F.

These guys definitely benefit from having some direct sun, so the indirect sun is a bit concerning, especially if the top of the plant isn't getting enough light. As well, these guys should be rooted in several places along the base of their stem and not just at the very end. In their natural habitat, they creep along the ground and root in several places so that they are securely attached to the ground and get plenty of nutrients."

75637,t3_gpco4s,My recently transplanted Cannabis seedlings have been getting small brown spots on thier lower leaves and some bottom leaves are turning yellow. Anyone able to tell what's going on?,"They look like spider mites. What’s on the underside of the leaf?  If it’s not a pest, it could also be a calcium deficiency.

If it’s spider mites you can buy local predatory bugs that you can release onto your plants. Otherwise neem oil but I’ve never had much success with that."
75150,t3_gon3qt,I think it's from my fertilizer (fish) but I'm finding a lot of what I think is mold on the inside of some of my plants and on the outside bottoms of my terracotta pots. Does this look troubling to anyone?,"I've never had fish do that, but that doesn't mean it couldn't happen.

What else can I do do nurse it back to glory?","It’s a heartleaf philodendron, very similar to pothos! It actually doesn’t look too bad.

If you zoom in it kinda looks like bugs with little legs."
74638,t3_gnxrxe,What are these brownish things on the schefflera tree and why do some leaves also get pretty sticky? What can be done to fully recover the plant?,"That is scale, a somewhat-common plant pest. 

I've never treated them before but you can look up ""scale treatment"" and find suggestions. First step is to isolate that plant so they don't spread to other plants.

I could be mistaken, but when I zoom in it also looks like there is some webbing? Is that the case or do you have pets/something else with stray hairs that are getting stuck?"
104317,t3_hyaim8,New monstera leaf has turned brown and stopped unfurling. I moved it to a brighter window and am going to be better about letting it dry out completely between waterings. Should I remove the new growth? How do I do that without hurting the plant?,"Leave the new growth until you see a new leaf shoot, then you can trim off the older leaf. I like to do this to be sure I don't trim into the new growth that could be forming inside the petiole. You can just wait until the new leaf emerges as well that's up to you. To help with over watering I would plant it into the terracotta you have the plastic pot sitting in, it will help the soil dry out faster. Good luck!"
104496,t3_hyfnox,"Are these black spots bad? What are they? (Also what kind of succulent is this?) And if I rotate it, will it straighten up?",Try r/succulents but I'm guessing too much water/poor draining soil and not enough bright light is your culprit.

The plant has what looks like roots growing from the leaf nodes. Some leaves have a small black spot. The soil is pretty moist. Is this plant ok?,Definitely repot as mentioned. I’ve had mine for a few months and they like to completely dry out before next water. They have succulent type leaves so they prefer less water over more
104736,t3_hyq4tk,Today I noticed some black spots on my new Monstera leaf. They wasn't there last night. What is it and what should I do?,I think it might have been your cat - my boyfriend drunkenly played with my baby monstera leaf and it got these black spots and is now unfurling and is obviously damaged.

Yesterday I noticed it was filled with gnats so I googled and sprayed the plant with a white vinegar/Dawn mix. Today my leaves are brown? How badly have I mucked up?

Haaaalp?","They need so little water, I keep mine in well draining soil and a teracotta pot and let it dry out COMPLETELY and wait for the leaves to droop a little before watering, and even then don't completely soak it. The fact that the leaf is yellowing tells me it's likely a watering issue."

The leafs are hanging but not dry yet. I just watered it a bit and will give more later. Will it be fine again?,"It should be ok. When you water it, water a lot at one time until you see the water coming out of the drainage holes. Then don’t water it for a few days or so. Should perk up again. Not sure what kind of plant that is so can’t give you specifics on how often to water/dry out. But it looks like it’s letting you know it’s thirsty for now lol. Good luck!

I water every 4-6 days til it drains out the bottom. 

I’ve had mine for about 6 months and it’s already split off into 2 small bushes (original was about your size) so it seems strange for it to stay like that for 2 years. I also have those green spots, but they mostly go away when I move it to shadier areas."

Soil usually comes pre-fertilized so if you've fertilized it again it could have been too soon, or it might have just had too much to begin with. It's perfectly harmless to your plant, stir it into the soil and brush it off at the drainage holes. It might return when you water again, just stir it back in. Don't fertilize again until the mold stops coming back.

Edit: Also want to add that hydrogen peroxide works well to clean the mold off any surfaces like the table. Just test in an inconspicuous place first."

83357,t3_h7hp11,I’m new to plant ownership and I need some help... can someone please tell me what I’m doing wrong with my peace lily?,"This is probably an irrigation issue. Both overwatering and underwatering will cause brown tips to occur. The general advice for Peace lilies is to let it slightly wilt between waterings, then water it thoroughly and repeat. Also keep an eye on humidity around the plant. If conditions are too dry, you could also see brown tips as a result.

EDIT: Are you keeping it in that saucer? Does the saucer always have water in it?"

Cut the leaf off, move it far from other plants and cross your fingers. Once the spots showed up my plants were doomed, even cutting off the visible infection, they died within a few days.

It was fast. 

I wish I had better news or some sort of cure. 

I’m much better at quarantining new plants though!"

I have my string of bananas in a terra cotta pot (takes moisture from the roots) and in a soil mixture of 50% perlite and 50% miracle gro cactus/succulent soil. It’s really happy in that. 

Big box store soil is terrible. You might want to consider either propagating it by cutting all the stems off and putting in water (making sure none of the pearls are submerged, so you could take some off) or you can try to rescue mission it by using the soil mixture I mentioned and putting into a (similarly size to what it’s in now) terra cotta pot. 

If you go the propagation route I suggest looking at r/proplifting. They have lots of info"

I took it inside figuring too much sunlight. now the new pitchers that are forming look dead?,"I am not familiar with this specific plant but I'm working on germinating some carnivores right now (Sundews though), and my understanding is that most carnivorous plants grow (in the wild) on moss on rocks near rivers... so their soil should always be moist (to my understanding, to the tune of: you can't over-water, and many like to be in a saucer of water), so my instinct is to say that if you think they're under-watered they probably are. And extra note: they should only be watered with rain water or distilled water, they cannot handle any of the chemicals in tap water and may struggle with the minerals as well."

What am I doing wrong?,"The flies in the dirt sound like fungus gnats! I use diatomaceous earth but there's other ways of getting rid of them. Both your issues have to do with keeping the soil too wet. I don't know about caring for cardamom but you could try watering from the bottom of the pot instead! 

Good luck!"
81800,t3_gz3u2e,"is my monstera salvageable?? the old leaves are turning yellow and every new leaf that sprouts goes black/brown and shrivels up. ive just re-potted it in this photo because the soil keeps going mouldy, does anyone have any advice for me please on how to save it?","Most likely root rot. Take it back out of the soil, and look for brown, mushy roots. Trim them off at the healthy root. Another way to tell if they’re rotten is the outer part of the root will easily slide off, leaving a thin pale string like root. Cut off all of the rot. Gently rinse it in slightly warm water (cold water shocks roots and your plant is already in shock) until most of the soil and gunk is off. I usually pat the roots and plant dry with a palate towel. Plant it in a pot with a drainage hole and make sure the soil is airy: indoor potting soil, small bark, perlite, etc. I usually wait a day or so to water it so the roots can dry out where I cut it. Water thoroughly after a day or so and let the water drain out the bottom. Put in a sunny spot and wait. The new growth is rotting because of the root rot. Also be careful when watering that you don’t get water on the leaves or the base of the stems."

93075,t3_hl7psj,I saved this calathea from Walmart. It had standing water at the bottom when I changed pots over 24 hours ago. The pot and soil are still soaking wet. Should I keep it to let it dry out itself or should I clean the roots off of the old soil/resoil it all?,I wouldn’t stress it out further. I killed some plants by repotting right away and not giving them some time to acclimate to the new environment. Judging from the photo it looks healthy with some new leaves unfurling.

How can I revive and help her stand back up?","For starters I would recommend checking for existing root rot (Although since its a new plant I dont think that will necesarily be the case). Does your pot have drainage holes? If not, repot into one that does using very airy soil :) Don't water it until the leaves appear slightly wrinkled. I would also set it into a little more soil in general, in this picture it seems like some of the roots might be exposed?

From the picture it also looks like the spot is not super bright, maybe move it closer to a west or south facing window ❤️

93510,t3_hlul3y,"Why is my Begonia suffering? Leaves are brown and soft and no new leaves unfurling. It’s never been repotted, could this be root rot?","I would say that it’s over watered and/or root rot. Stems look healthy so I would dry it out before you repot it, find a humid or warm spot in your home and wait until the soil is dry to repot it. If it starts to deteriorate quickly them as a last resort, repot it while soil is wet."

What can I do to help it or is it too late?,"I personally would throw this in the trash...You may be able to save it, but you’ll have to treat a few times to get it all. 
Take it out of the pot cause you’re gonna want to treat the roots too. Wipe away visible mealies with cotton ball/qtip dipped in iso alcohol. I would use a shower head or sink sprayer to physically dislodge them as well. Dunk this bad boy in some soapy water, let it sit in the water for a minute. Rinse again with water.

At least the scale is all out in the open where you can deal with it.  I just spent most of this summer battling scale on a schefflera  by going over it leaf by leaf, every day.  It became like a meditation for me, clearing my mind to examine the plant leaf by leaf and wiping with alcohol or (once there weren't so many) gently scraping the scale off with my fingernail.

Better to let it get well near dry before rewatering. May consider adding a bit more sand to your potting mix to improve drainage, but keep in mind this will reduce the total water holding capacity."

That means too large a pot will say too soggy.   

Additionally the soil isn't showing any perlite in it- citrus plants want a fast draining soil that doesn't hold on to too much moisture.   When you repot in a smaller pot add at least 40% perlite to the potting soil. If you'd rather you can use a soil mix for succulents.  

And try to develop the habit of keeping all leaf debris cleared out- rotting organic material on the surface of the soil can lead to bacterial infection problems.

Your pot is too large and the soil looks too dense.   
I'd recommend a smaller pot and a faster draining soil mix."

54913,t3_fldt9v,Please help my first plant. It’s a peace lily from Lowe’s. I only use distilled water. I’ve been very scared to over water it but the leaves always seem to droop like crazy three days after watering. Is the pot just too small? It has drainage holes. What about the brown flowers?,"Pull it out of the plastic pot and check to see if it’s root bound. Those fuckers grow roots like mad in my experience. If it’s rootbound pot in a bigger pot.

Keep out of direct sunlight, but most of the time brown flowers are spent flowers, snip them off as low to the plant as you can with sterile scissors.

Peace lilies are on a different level of drama, so once you repot and water it’ll be fine. Dropping typically means it wants water but be careful of overwatering."

It doesn't yellow, just goes straight to dried-out brown from the start and then stays damaged like the lower leaf. Other leaves look fine and healthy, no yellowing/browning, this only affects new leaves as they develop.

The plant is placed in the back of the room approx 4-5 meters from window, no direct sunlight and low light, watered when top inches of soil start to dry out.

Every time mine dries out I soak it again.  I feel like the yellowing could be from under watering/over watering. Changing soil should help.
137587,t3_jd5cdj,Why does my Brasil Philodendron look so sad? I've had it for six months and it was always really bushy and happy but lately it looks like it's about to die. I water once a week...too much?,"Yes that's likely too much. Check the roots for rot. If you find any, cut it off. Replant it in fresh soil and don't water for about 2ish days. Then water thoroughly (personally i prefer bottom watering), and from then on only water when the soil is pretty much dried out, or until you see the leaves start to go slightly limp. 

You may also want to consider putting it in better draining soil - mix a generous amount of orchid bark and perlite in to the soil. This isnt absolutely necessary but it will help you with moisture regualtion a lot, and reduce the risk of root rot if you think you may over water it again in the future."

Any tips?,"If you're trying moss propagation, make sure it's the right kind of moss first! Sphagnum moss or orchid moss (which is just cleaner, higher quality sphagnum moss) is the way to go. If you purchase it dried, you'll want to ""activate"" it by soaking it in warm water. You'll want to squeeze most of the moisture out of the moss - you want it damp, but not soaking wet.

1. This aloe plant looks flimsy and could benefit from a good bottom watering. Place it in a shallow bucket of water for 20 minutes or so and see what happens in a week.

2. All plants need to be acclimated to light, whether it’s direct or indirect. Think about it, you know how you always get the worst sun burns at the beginning of summer, but as time goes on your skin adjusts to the UV rays? Same thing goes for plants.

I watered it the first day I got it but only a small amount. I have been taking it outside and letting it get indirect sunlight in the shade but maybe the was too much?,Don't over water and no direct sun. Make sure it has well draining soil. If you keep it inside only water it once or twice a month depending on the soil you use. If it outside maybe water 2 or 3 times a month because it's hot out and it will dry up fast. They're pretty easy to keep alive if you follow those rules. They do better outside from my experience but also do fine inside as well. I have several.

Mine has recovered completely and is thriving, after moving a bit away from direct sunlight and letting it completely dry out before watering it.

Look for tiny, skinny, black insects, or tiny, skinny yellowish-white-translucent larvae. The adult insects can fly so inspect any other nearby plants as well. 

I've never managed to fully get rid of thrips on my basil (and I've taken fresh cuttings and disposed of the older growth, kept them isolated, without soil, in a glass of water, washed them every day). There are lots of different treatment methods, but for basil I'm stumped. Someone else on here told me just the other day they managed to get rid of them by using neem oil, so maybe that can work.

The trunk also has brown spots...is that normal?,"Can you remember which one appeared first, the spots on the trunk or the spots on the leaves? A picture of the trunk spots would allow us to examine closer. This looks like an infection of some sort, probably bacterial or fungal. Keep a close eye on it and look at the bottom of the leaves as well. There are many fungi (such as rusts) that tend to form structures underneath leaves. If the trunk got infected first, then it probably is something in the soil. Look for any pests as well, there may be insect vectors involved.

Given the photos you showed, I am leaning very heavily toward a below-ground issue. Infection pattern tends to start from the vascular veins, which would be responsible for transporting the pathogen."
117077,t3_igaa44,My calathea is dying. This unfortunately isn't the first time this happened. Does anyone know what's going wrong?,"The others are correct. Calatheas are thirsty! Just wanted to let you know that in case your pot doesn't have a drainage hole (looks like the type of pot that usually doesn't) you should definitely repot into something that does have drainage holes. Having drainage holes means that you can water more thoroughly without fear of drowning your plant. 

Depending on the size of the root system, you might also want to get a smaller pot. Big pots hold too much soil, which holds too much moisture, which can smother the roots, which eventually leads to rot. I also like to mix some perlite into my soil to help even more with drainage. :)"

68479,t3_gdkob9,my succulent is suffering from some major stretching and the stems can’t support themselves anymore :( is this reversible?,Your plant is stretching because it isnt getting enough light.  He also desperately needs a haircut.  Trim down the stems (check out some youtube videos about trimming succulents). You can also re-plant the pieces you trimmed and in a few weeks they will grow roots. IMPORTANT: you want to slowly acclimate him into direct light.

How can I save this tree??,"So yes I was able to save the leaves, but the splotches just dried out and never healed :(

That’s a great sign that you have new growth though! It might just be because the environment isn’t as consistent as it would like it to be (heat after rain). Have you fertilized at all? I’ve noticed these prefer slow release fertilizer. Bottom watering might work..get a container you can fit the pot in and fill it up with about 4” of water. You’ll see the water level go down as the soil absorbs the water..add some more water as it’s being absorbed. It may take about 10-15 mins but once it stops absorbing water you can take it out and set it on a saucer to catch excess water. This also helps with insects because you essentially never have to wet the top inch of soil 😃

Foliage looked healthy, but a day later I realized it had spider mite (eggs? adults? they were white specks) all over the backs of its leaves. The first day I hosed it down, but realized after more reading that this wouldn’t get rid of the problem. I have several plants in my collection with no history of pests and can’t afford to have them infected.

Today I decided to take an aggressive approach, and after wiping down my room and moving my other plants, drenched the leaves with the alcohol/soap solution and gently scrubbed them with a paintbrush. I removed the plant from as much old soil as I could (there was still some compacted soil at its base) and hosed it down further, this time hosing the root system as well. I sprayed with the alcohol/soap solution one last time and re-potted into fresh soil, watering like normal after.

I know this calathea had some rough treatment today, but as it started off healthy, I hope it will survive what it went through.

62386,t3_g2flua,New Pothos leaves are unfurling looking burnt / crispy - got this plant last week. Is it just getting used to less humidity in my place compared to the green house?,"i had this issue too. i brought home a big, beautiful pothos. after settling into my apartment for a couple weeks, the new leaves coming in had these burnout sections like yours (brown, not yellow, usually starting in the middle &amp; causing a hole), but the others looked healthy and happy. the leaves that came in after the browned ones were also happy and healthy. i did some research and found 2 potential issues that seemed relevant. 

first, scattered brown patches usually in the middle of leaves could be caused by: abrupt change from very high temperatures to moderate temperatures can cause this discoloration, especially if plants are succulent and growing vigorously. (i read this to mean: going from the humid, toasty nursery to my dry-ass, cold apartment). to fix: maintain even, warm temperatures. (source: [https://mrec.ifas.ufl.edu/Foliage/folnotes/pothos.htm](https://mrec.ifas.ufl.edu/Foliage/folnotes/pothos.htm))

the other thing i found was that a change or lapse in the watering schedule the plant is accustomed to could cause the brown spots. that made sense to me too, as i let the pothos ""fall"" before watering it - maybe a little too much, and i think it panicked. unfortunately i can't find the source i used here, i apologize.

not sure if this is exactly what's happening here, but it could be a place to start. hope you find it helpful. good luck!"

Since these leaves are much smaller than the ones next to them, I wonder if their patch of soil isn't getting as much water inside the pot.

Either way i don’t think that’s why the leaf is yellow. How long have you had it, how close to the window/window direction/hours of light per day, how do you determine when to water and how much water do you give each time?"

I recommend repotting this guys in a terracotta pot with good drainage. You’ll want to carefully inspect the roots and cut off any mushy ones. Let them dry for a day or so and then plant in succulent soil mix. You want that soil to be gritty rather than rich and you want the water to drain and dry quickly between waterings.

Any idea how this happened?","I suspect a watering issue. Overwatering is likely the culprit. I rarely water my orchids. Every 2-3 weeks. They are epiphytes meaning they naturally grow on trees, in a rainforest environment. So think high environmental humidity, with an occasional watering or brief soak if the leaves start to wrinkle. They do not appreciate standard pots. I suggest getting an orchid pot which will more closely mimic their natural habitat. They like some air around the roots. And I would report and change the growing medium once the flower is spent. No soil. Use a decent orchid bark, it will have some pumice mixed in to retain a little extra moisture without being too damp. Good luck! I have five orchids, four of which are blooming right now. I love them. They seem difficult to grow at first, but with epiphytes you just have to forget everything you know about container and soil gardening and think of what it would be like up in the tree canopy.

If the roots are healthy then all is good. Whenever you loosen up the root ball the plant will either go into a shock or not, in this case it is. I've done this to a few of my plants and notice this as well. What I found out is the roots has these small tiny hairs and they can easily get damaged when loosening the roots. There are products you can buy that will prevent transplant shock. You can also buy rooting inoculate which is a beneficial bacteria that attaches to the roots to help them absorb nutrients and water better during a transplant. They are in a powder form and that you sprinkle in the soil where the roots go and also on the roots.

If you don't want to buy any extra stuff you can 

1. Be patient and see if it will adjust. If not within a few days, try repotting it again but differently than the previous time. Example) my scindapsus pictus that I repotted since it was stagnant. All leaves started to curl and stayed like that for a few weeks no matter how much water and light I gave it. I repotted it about 3 times total where I made the soil aerate but somewhat compact. I bottomed water the plant and left it there until it soaked up all the water and left a pool of water in the bowl it was in for 20min then I let it drain.

Normally kept in low light - more sun needed?,"This is in kind of a weird place to be caused by root issues, insufficient sun or even crown rot. Usually root and sunlight related leaf drop happens on older leaves first. Crown rot tends to be focused around the stem area. This looks like it might be a fungal or bacterial infection of some kind. You could try spraying it with a copper fungicide if you have some. If it changes day to day you'll probably have to remove the leaf soon anyway.

In general this plant needs to be kept in higher light to do well long term. I'd suggest several hours of direct sun per day- please acclimate it before moving it into direct sun though. Lack of light probably didn't cause this but may have contributed to a general weakness in the plant."

205291,t3_mwj3ro,HELP SAVING MY MONSTERA FROM ROOT ROT!!!! I have cut off all infected roots and did an antibacterial rinse with dish-soap. Does she look healthy enough to make it?

22624,t3_cl61ge,"My calathea has spider mites. I’m hosing the leaves in the shower and wiping the leaves everyday, But how can she best recover from it? She used to be dark green and beautiful, now her leaves are light, spotted and curled. Advice?","Spider mites are the worst. Keep her far away from any other plants, as mites like to travel through the air.

Pick up some miticide and use that over and over again until the plant hasn't had an infestation in a few months.

I also used a wet paper towel with a little dish soap on it and wiped the mites from the leaves every night. I also trimmed off super infested leaves, as they are so damaged they are only hurting the plant by harbouring the mites.

If they keep coming back, you'll need to repot. There are also beneficial insects you can buy and release to eat the mites. If none of this works, you'll have to toss the little dude. Don't get too attached, mites ruin everything."
200747,t3_mozrps,"I’m seeing a lot of yellowish, fuzzy mold throughout the soil, but my alocacia looks fairly healthy.. should I be worried?","More context: I scraped the mold before watering last time, but they grew back.

205368,t3_mwqpg7,Old owner left this aloe plant that was leaning all the way over. Should I keep it propped up like this or could I split it into 2 plants maybe?,"Sorry for the format, on mobile!

Oh boy! Get ready for an aloe party!! Find at least five pots and some soil, preferably cactus soil or similar. Get to a table that you don't mind getting dirty (I'd advise outside) and knock this mama out of her home. Gently tease the earth off her, like you've just courted her in the bar, and finally got her into your hotel room for a sweet, sweet one-night-repotting sesh. You should find a couple of plants that seem connected with a few thin roots. These are called pups, they are her babies. I can see at least 2 pups in your pic.  

Now fill your new pots with soil, separate the babies from their mama and give them a new home. Make sure the lowers leaves are resting gently on the soil. Good spritz of water and buckle up for a temper tantrum, some of them will hate their new home. Tough luck, they'll get used to it! 

Depending on the type of aloe style you like you could prop the lowest leaves of the motherplant in soil. Let the leaves scab over just by leaving them to air-dry a few days. The bit that was attached to the motherplant will go from wet and shiny to opaque and dry. Plonk them in their own container and wait. For. Months. But free aloe's, so yeah!

You could also replant her whole. Find a pot that is bigger than you think you need. Maybe twice as wide as the current one, maybe even wider, and plant her in the middle. Water and wait. In my experience these aloe tend to get lanky in pots that are too tight. Aloe need time to acclimatize, so any growth or temper tantrums will take time. Remember that you are the adult, and they will pretend to die. Keep at it untill they are literally crispy. I've had leaf props turn yellow and almost translucent, and still turn into a lovely plant. When they do, waterdiet. No water for drama queens. Then water a little and see how far you get. (I think some aloe hate new soil, to nutritious/healthy. So I have used old potting soil, or rinsed out soil in the past. That can sometimes help also.)

Alternatively, you could harvest some leaves for a nice face or hair mask. I've heard people use aloe s a type of hair gel or mousse!

I’m not convinced that was enough drainage, and think I should probably get a new pot, but as I mentioned in the title, the move to a sunnier location seemed to encourage growth and fenestrations in new leaves. 

A new leaf just sprouted and it’s black and sticky at the tip. Does that mean root rot?"

In the middle row, third from the top, that looks like a Crassula blue wave.

Just try not to touch or disturb the roots. This is easier to do when the soil is on the dryer side.

But I think that this reminds me of sunburn. Did the foliage get brown after you moved it outside? A good method to bring your plant outside is to acclimate it SLOWLY. You could for example start by positioning it in the shade and slowly move it to get direct sunlight.

Edit: quick mentioning, the soil dries up much faster when the plant is outside. Check the soil before watering."

Watering peperomia can be tricky, that’s for sure! There are some that will tolerate drying out completely and some that need consistent moisture.

Your mix looks very gritty and it's in a terracotta pot so I wouldn't immediately suspect root rot or anything. They look pretty healthy otherwise. Did you recently move them outside? If so, did you acclimate them over several days to higher light?"

Worse still is that I found them on most of my other plants too! What are they and how do I kill them?","These are thrips. They suck. I hate to tell you, but you are looking at investing a couple of weeks into pest control. The black bugs are the adult stage. The larva are small, white/translucent and nearly impossible to see. They hatch from the soil. 

I've never tried Neem oil, because I'm scared it'll be too harsh on my plants. Plus I have a lot of plants and found it cost prohibitive. 

I did buy a plant safe pesticide and sprayed my plants ever couple of days for a couple weeks which seems to kill off the infestation. 

And then I found another thrip. Sigh. 

I have kind of given up ever being totally rid of these guys, but I do keep them under control by looking over my plants frequently, using blue stick paper, and misting my plants with a very dilute dish soap solution once every week or two."

They like to be soaked in water for about 15 min when dry and only up to the top make sure it doesn’t touch the crown or it could get crown rot. And then let it drain well.

5485,t3_aj2w9b,Bought this money tree off amazon. It arrived yesterday with some broken stems and now it appears to be dying after less than 24 hrs. Can I save her?,Buying plants off of Amazon is pretty much a crapshoot to begin with.  Buying tropicals in the winter in a cold climate is even more so.  And getting it delivered when a good chunk of the country is in the coldest part of the year just makes it that much harder.  Try visiting a local nursery or waiting for a better weather window if you have to order plants online.

Are there any treatments I can do?,"There's a lot of posts on here about using bacterial larvicide in the form of mosquito dunks/bits for fungus gnats.

It was like this with the left most variegated leaf and now the leaf that’s just came out is even yellower, the plant seems healthy and is producing a second leaf already. Is this potentially harmful?","I'd guess it's because it's a new leaf. New leaves usually have more vibrant color, whether it's green or a variegation. I wouldn't be worried unless the color stays that way once it's fully grown. If it does I'd say it isn't getting enough light (variegation diminishes in lower light) or that it's just a natural range of variegation color. But I'd say my first guess is most likely."

Should I cut the healthy strands &amp; root in water?","At this point I would cut off the healthy strands and root them, in soil not water. My guess would be that the soil was unsuitable as it looks pretty dark here, and so even though you watered it infrequently, it possible stayed wet too long when watered. My string of pearls are in a 50/50 sand and all purpose potting soil mix and have done well in a variety of watering conditions."

You don't have to soak for a whole hour, 10-15 minutes is enough. 

Orchid roots need air flowing around them, if they're crammed closely in a plastic container without holes, I'd worry that they will start rotting. You might want to find a better pot for your plant. Orchid pots are usually clear plastic, but they should have drainage holes."

212420,t3_n9fj7l,My philodenron birkin looks like it's crying. 😥 Will this leaf heal? There's a hardened tear drop of sap on it? Too much light?,"Nope, it won't heal.  Birkins are a hodgepodge mix of Philodendron species.  The white leaves are not viable, and don't last long, and once the plant starts producing them, it is necessary to prune the plant back to where the green leaves are still being produced, or you risk losing the whole plant."

It's a common mistake in tree nursing, they cut the roots and dig them too deep in the ground. The tree will kill it's lower roots to grow more on the part that is newly submerged. This is when they don't have a big enough rootsystems that they can't collect all the water/nutrients they need and they die."

Wherever you cut make sure you’re using sterilized sheers or scissors. 45 degree cut, put cinnamon on the cut as it’s anti bacterial and microbial.

You should also stilt the leaves up near the neck of the leaf, because when that plant grows and gets too heavy, where you have it held, it will snap and or bend and then you will lose that leaf. 

No mid stalk cinching! Use plant tape, it’s cheap to buy and it won’t leave marks like zip ties."

Help did I do this right?","I think it looks great! The mix looks nice and chunky:) It's a bit of a jump from 8"" to 12"", but it will be fine. In my experience it might take a little longer to push out new growth since it will be busy trying to fill the pot with roots. I'd cut back on the watering as well, it probably dried out a lot faster in its old pot when it was root bound than it will in its roomy new home :)"

What kind of soil do you have it in? It looks very peaty. These plants don't like to sit in really wet soil, so make sure you have some fast draining soil. How much are you watering and how often?

Any ideas why it’s decided to stop growing?,"I would probably get it into a little bit brighter light and see if that will stimulate some growth. A lot of plants will tolerate low light, but won’t necessarily grow or thrive, since low light in a house is much dimmer than any light outside, even in the shade. Move him somewhere where he’ll get bright light, but not be hit with direct sunlight that could burn his leaves—a little morning light is OK.

You want to put overwatered plants in shade to recover. Take it out the pot and have a look at the roots. If they're pale or brown and strong, you're good. If they're black and mushy, you've got root rot. Cut the rotten parts and keep what's healthy. Let me know.

Moist is very different to wet. Get yourself a nositure meter? In future, what you should do is dip your finger deep into the soil. If it sticks to your finger, it's moist. If it's dryish, pick the pot up and have a look at the soil underneath. You'll be able to tell if that dry, moist or wet. Wet is only momentary. It should be after you watered it, maybe for a day or so. Wet is not moist!"

I'd say check out miss orchid girl on YouTube, mixed reviews but I think her knowledge is solid.

But something I'd check for is root damage or root rot. Overwatering is very common. You can just slide the whole plant out of the pot, maybe put something down to catch the wood chips. Watch a video on orchid root rot before, so you know what to look/smell for. 

Also, I mist the air roots every few days and water when I don't see any condensation on the inside of my pot, which is clear. That could be weeks in between actual waterings."

Straight from sheltered indoors out into the wind and sun?

Also, as robotjonny noted, you definitely need drainage holes in the bottom if you didn't already drill those in the bottom.

As for pruning, have a look at http://www.instructables.com/id/Pruning-Tomatoes-for-Maximum-Yield/
Some varieties shouldn't be pruned, but if this is the case it would be noted on the seed packs or website.

Larger suckers make great cuttings, and tomato cuttings root easily. Just stuff it in a flower pot with dirt, and make sure to water it and not let it dry out. 
The cuttings will look sad for a week or two, and then start to look healthier.

If your plants are just in shock from moving, and not waterlogged, try moving them to a location that is a little more sheltered from the wind if possible. They'll probably recover in a couple of weeks if this is the problem.

In the future, when moving plants out, it is a good idea to do it slowly. Start with 15min or so the first day, and then extend the time over multiple days before moving completely. Cloudy, mostly wind free days are best when starting."

It's very difficult to figure out how much and when to water with them. Terracotta pots are the best type of pots , in my opinion, because they drain and allow the dirt to dry out between waterings.

18924,t3_cau742,Help. Is this aloe Vera rotting? What should I cut off? Why are there green leaves underground when the leaves above ground are suffering?,"It looks fine to me, granted I can’t see the top leaves. Rule of thumb is if it has new growth then it’s healthy overall."

18811,t3_cam13f,"What can I do for them? They’re both in direct light and watered occasionally, but I obviously don’t know how to care for them... I’m thinking bad soil as well?","First thing first, either move them out of direct sunlight or put a sheer curtain between the window and them. Second, I’m assuming the one on the left is a pothos and the one of the right is a snake plant? If so, both should be watered when pretty much dry (may notice leafs and vines are looking droopy and are more malleable on the pothos). The pothos when it is mostly dry and the snake plant when it is DRY dry. (With the snake plant you’ll notice the leaves look wrinkly which means it needs water). I would try these before messing with the soil and sending it into repot shock. Hope this helps :)"

What is it and how can we help it?","first thing i would do is take the plant out of the pot, take the wood chippings out of the roots. if any roots are squishy, cut them off. only cut off the squishy rotting roots! i would let the phal. orchid dry out for half an hour, then plant it in dry chips.

phal orchids are an epiphyte, so in their natural habitat they grow on other trees (not in soil) and get their way after from the rainwater and humidity in the air.

the best way to water a phal orchid is to have a pot with plenty of holes. if you look up orchid pot on amazon, you’ll see many. you want to plant the orchid in the pot with dry wood chippings, then about every week or so, take a small bowl of rainwater or distilled water (no tap water! extra added minerals are bad for the orchid) and dunk the bottom of the pot in the water for about 5-10 minutes. you want to ensure not only the roots are getting wet, but also the wood chippings. then take the orchid out, let it dry out and repeat in a week! orchids dont like to sit in water, except the wood chippings will provide them with water for the rest of the week. the wood chippings should be dry to the touch next time you water them. 

i would also cut the dead flower spikes. cut them off at the base of the plant.

I was doing some trimming and uncovered this.... anyone know what this is and what caused it?,"It’s some kind of saphotropic fungus(eats dead matter in soil), chances are good it’s there because of a combination of two factors: Too much moisture, not enough airflow. Trimming it so air can move across the soil is a good idea. In general, your soil is probably staying too wet for too long as well. You might need a better draining potting mix, a drainage hole(if your pot lacks one), less frequent waterings, or some combination of the three. 

If you want to get rid of it, you might have to repot in new soil, and sterilize the pot if you intend to reuse the same one."

31333,t3_dbxr4k,"My Swedish Ivy is in a constant state of decay, constantly losing leaves but growing new ones faster than it's losing them. Is this normal?","Hey I just found this in your post history after noticing you had a Swedish ivy in your most recent pic. I wanted to say that I had a Swedish ivy that also had an illness but it looked different. In my case, leaves would slowly turn like this: https://imgur.com/a/tDLotWV 

I know that’s not really helpful since it looks to be a different situation but the point is that I think that they are really finicky plants in terms of getting sick. I have a few other plants that all seem to be doing fine but the swedish ivy just always seemed to have a few leaves sick. It had a few vines that were great but every now and then some of the leaves would start to slowly grow those black spots which makes me think it was some illness.

Anyway I did some searching and found this description which maybe matches your situation? 

“Mites are tiny arachnids, hardly detectable with the naked eye. These little guys literally suck the life out of plant cells, causing yellow dots to appear on leaf surfaces. As they spread out, the yellow dots grow together, resulting in widespread yellowing. Other signs include puckered or distorted leaves, leaves that drop easily and fine, silk threads near damage. Regular misting and treatment with insecticidal soap will destroy mites in no time.

Read more at Gardening Know How: Ivy Turning Yellow: Reasons For Yellowing Leaves On Ivy Plants https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/houseplants/ivy/ivy-turning-yellow.html “ any idea if you might have mites? Have you changed your watering habit recently?

If you figure anything out let me know. I decided to discard most of my ivy out of an abundance of  caution and took the healthiest cuttings so that I can restart it from a clean slate and the cuttings seem to be taking well. Either way let me know what you find out with your plant. I don’t think too many people on this sub have Swedish ivy based on a search of post histories so we gotta stick together, lol.

EDIT: Is the ivy in direct sunlight or is it filtered through a curtain? Or is it indirect light based on the path of the sun? My plant always had light filtered through a curtain so never really direct light. I never had anything resembling your situation on my plant, whether on the healthy vines or the ones with a few sick leaves. Maybe that helps diagnose your situation."

That’s what this looks like. Get out the pruning shears and start pruning back to wherever the stems still have some green life in them. Then trim them back a bit more. If you’re lucky then there’s still some life in the tree. 

You’re going to need to reduce the size of your tree by at least half. If you didn’t transplant many roots, then you need to trim it back even more.

To start off with I would take the rocks off the soil and take a look at what's going on under there. Check out the roots and make sure everything looks good with no rot and see if the pot size and soil mix is appropriate

If everything looks good in the pot make sure it wasnt just repotted by your friend and if not get it started on a fertilizer program. I fertilize mine once a month with liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength 

Water it thoroughly when the top 2 to 3 inches of soil is dry and put it somewhere that it gets bright but indirect sun

I heard they are not meant to be house plants so I have to keep it outside I think. Will it survive???,"It will be MUCH happier if you plant it in the ground.  This is a battle between freezing temps, drying winds, sufficient water, and insufficient drainage.    I have lost virtually all temperate shrubs I try to treat as houseplants.  Here are some guesses that other reddtors may improve on:

To plant in winter:  If your ground is currently frozen, pour in many gallons of room temp (or even hot, if you don't mind what happens to the existing plants) water *until the soil is warm enough (about room temp)* for the plant to have a decent home.  When spring first arrives, warm the ground with the room temp water and if you have good enough drainage try to keep it that way a good amount of time.

To keep it outdoors in a pot:

(a)  It's not good for the root ball to freeze solid.   And the leaves will dry out from a combination of frozen roots and wind. Bring it inside when temps are below 25oF.

(b)  If you water it enough to help the leaves, the roots risk rot from overwatering."

Your plant should be indoors at all times, and should be watered when he’s about 50-75% dry. You can water at any time of day you please, just make sure to evenly moisten the soil, and let it drain (as opposed to sitting in water). Alocasias also enjoy an amount of humidity in the air, so not enough moisture in the air could also be a factor.

85997,t3_hbigwf,"This plant was doing great in indirect light, was moved outside for hours and a week later looks like this. Watered regularly, temperature is regulated in room. Will it recover?","You were correct to move it out of direct sun, if that's where it was outside. It would do well on a covered porch, but will burn in sunlight. Sterilize some clippers or scissors with alcohol and then cut the dead and near-dead leaves off. Water the plant only when its soil is completely dried out (check with your finger, down to about a knuckle). Then water it until water seeps out of the bottom -- and by the way, make sure it has drainage so water can drain out. The plant will recover."

Any way to restart the growth for this year?","So the box was hiding in plain sight since around mid November. During that time it had no light, water, soil, and was kept a little cool. I was surprised to see it already in bloom when I opened the box.

While it's charming how it is now all things considered, I'm hoping I can get it to grow properly for the spring. Should I let the current bloom die then trim it, or should I try to cut it now? Is it too late to get a proper planting?

I do have a pot for it, and I planned to set it up properly if possible this year. Right now I have it just resting in a little cup as the shape of the stem/flower wasn't right for planting. "

Help?","While Sedum 'Little Missy' is a succulent, I think it's too delicate to go through the mail without incurring shock like this.  I would trim the dead bits and leave it alone in indirect light as you have to recover.  Only water again when the plant seems droopy.

The middle one has a growing black spot on it. The two little guys on the right feel fine. How can I aid them?,"How long ago did you repot it? This also happened to me when I decided to move mine from its nursery pot into a larger plastic pot. I know that these plants really do not like to be too moist, so I poked some holes in the soil (gently) to help increase aeration. I also moved it from its spot in a north-east facing window to a partially obstructed west-facing window. After about 4 days, it started to look better and seems to be thriving. So, I would give it some time to see if the soil dries out a bit more and if some brighter (indrect) light will help."

374869,t3_zb4lja,"my peace lily stems have bent and won’t bounce back, i’ve been watering it and kept it in the proper lighting for over 2 weeks. should i just cut the ones that are bent?","Give it way more light. Peace lily is a ''low light'' plant only if you live in south Florida without winter. Peace lily with winter blues is very common. As long as it's not sitting in front of a large south facing window without curtains, the more light the better.

Only water when there is some leaf droop, it's the best way to know when to water it. It will bounce back the next day with no harm. It's a super easy plant because it tells you when it needs water. You don't water it when you want to, you water it when it droops a little and the top soil is dry.

Not now tho, that drooping is clearly not because it's thirty.

Also I hope your pot has good drainage. Standing water is probably the only way to kill this plant quickly."

Also, I think you should give it a spray with neem oil every couple of weeks... it seems there is some type of damage but I can’t tell if it’s bug related or just got banged up. And the new leafs in the middle that are emerging - I can’t tell if they are black on the ends or if it’s just how it grows. 

Neem oil is the biggest, but safest, weapon in my arsenal. 

You might try a closed terrarium to maintain a balanced humidity level. 

Really, though, it seems pretty healthy."

Maybe it needs repotting?","It's hard to get watering right with no drain holes, and that is a fairly large plant for the pot. Honestly the rest of it looks pretty healthy so I lean more towards it needing more root room to absorb enough nutrients to support the leaves. I think repotting to a pot with drainage holes, and checking for root rot (mushy, often stink roots) in the process is probably a good idea.

We have had this guy for about 4 months, and around 2 months ago his leaves started going yellow, and a month later, the spots started turning brown.
 
We are in Australia, and were transitioning from fall/autumn to winter.

We were using tap water when watering, and found out that they're sensitive to the chemicals, so we started collecting rain water for him.

When we switched to rainwater for him, we also put him on the tray of pebbles with water to give him humidity.

When we first got him, we was living in moderate to low light conditions, we're a north/west facing window. We have since moved him to a South/west facing window, but not in direct sunlight.

When we put him on the pebble tray, we also noticed some tiny little black bugs on the bottom of the leaves, which we treated with a pest spray, and they have now gone and haven't returned!

This new leaf came through and we were super excited, but it's starting to curl and turn colour.

What are we doing wrong/what can we do for him?"
375170,t3_zcdzyi,my rubber plant has been dropping and shows some discoloration. I think I have been watering it well and providing it with daily indirect sunlight. My location is a bit on the drier side so I have a humidifier going too. do y'all have any clue what the discoloration means?,"The discoloration resembles the discoloration caused by spider mites. I have not grown this particular Ficus, so I can't say that this is fer sher spider mites.  Because of the thick waxy coat on these leaves, I would be surprised if spider mites could get through that coating.

Look on the undersides of the leaves.  If it IS spider mites, you may already have webbing on the undersides of the leaves.  If you find webbing, isolate this plant from other plants immediately.

IF the plant has spider mites, wipe the leaves carefully with a warm, damp cloth.  The leaves should be stiff and waxy enough to handle this.  Wiping will remove most mites AND their eggs.  Wipe the stems, too."

Fittonias like their soil to be moist, but not overly wet, and need at least a decent level of humidity. While it can handle a little bit of drying and it will show that by drooping a bit, you don’t want to let that happen too much, or it can be too shocking for the plant.

You can let a pothos dry out a little between waterings, but you don't leave it dry. Give it a thorough soaking - until water runs and runs out the drainage hole. And do that every time the pot feels light (no water in there weighing it down) or the leaves start to droop slightly (in other words, before it gets to this point)."

The left one was fine before, why is it looking so sad now?","Some plants droop their leaves to conserve energy, especially on hot days.

316149,t3_uaatzw,I just found 5 mealy bugs on 3 plants and am freaking out. I have 20 plants and have had plants for about 7 years. First time seeing them. I got rid of one plant that had 2. I’m not sure how bad this is or what to do except try to save some. I’m panicking. Any advice?,"A systemic pesticide will do the trick, and you can give it to your other plants to prevent spread, too. If you have pets it will make the plants very toxic for them if they chew, though."
13480,t3_buy6va,I’m pretty sure spider mites are the culprit here. Would it be safe to spray this nepenthes with neem oil or do I need to repot him?,"Spider mites usually leave webs which do not see.  Since the brown spots are right in the middle of your leaves, I would suspect root rott. So maybe I would wait until the soil is completely dry before the next watering.

Edit: I don't know that plant so well"

69149,t3_ges0s2,Hey Plant Friends—I got this Blue Star Fern yesterday and only now noticed all the white spots. What could they be?,Can you wipe them off? Are they crystalline? It looks like guttation. It usually happens if a plant is watered heavily after a dry period; inconsistent watering.

13264,t3_buad9v,"help! every time I water my burro’s tail, it gets overwatered yellow leaves. Am I doing something wrong?","I agree that it probably needs better draining soil. Also, I think you can probably afford to water less. Those leaves look PLUMP. Even if the soil has dried out, I wouldn't water again until the leaves start shriveling. You can tell it is thirsty because the leaves will look more and more like raisins. If you water it when the leaves are already completely full, there's no more room for it to store water and the cells burst causing the leaf to die."

Roots have started to grow but recently I’ve noticed some brown tips on the leaves as well as a discolored smaller leaf (yellow green). What can I do about this??,Are you changing the water every week or so? Brown spots could be from lack of light too.

Tips on how to stop death?,"Did anything change for it in the environment? If you just moved it outdoors into the sun, it's probably shock from the sudden change."
312414,t3_tzfmmg,"My dracena rapidly started dropping leaves and I assume it's due to underwatering. I water it rarely, not to overwater it. I checked the roots, they seemed dried out badly so I changed the soil and watered it. The leaves are still yellowing and I remove them daily.

If you have one try running a humidifier near the plant to help it out a little more.
312847,t3_u0nawu,Confused about my ZZ. Lately my ZZ’s leaves and stems been rotting off. At first it gets weak on the stem like in the second picture and just gradually rottens off. Took it out of the soil - roots looks healthy to me. Any ideas?,"Rhizomes looks wrinkly/potentially soft to me in the first pic. Sometimes the rot can start there before the roots begin to suffer. Do you top water your zz (as in water the top of the soil and let it drain)? If so, you may consider bottom watering in a bowl of water so that the rhizomes aren’t getting wet and the soil around them doesn’t get as wet."
312838,t3_u0mm0b,"is this plant dead? came to my mom's place and seen this plant here I asked her what it was supposed to be, she said it was some shrub like tree. it's been like this for 2 years. is it worth putting some attention to be saved?",That has been dead for two years and you want to know if it can be resurrected?

376055,t3_zgj9kc,Green aphids have entered the chat. Immediately put it outside. No signs on any other plants. What precautions should I take?,"They're so adorable---especially to ants.  Currently dealing with a few on the Coleus cuttings I brought inside for the Winter.  Your plant looks tough enough to handle the treatment I've been using.

The aphids will rinse right off by putting the affected areas under high flow of warm water.....kitchen sink or that little hose attachment that many sinks have.  Check closely after the first rinse. Have no mercy.  

Outside should be OK as long as the nighttime temps don't test this plant's cold tolerance.  

After the initial rinse off, I'd check back every 2-3 days for any stowaways.  Rinse them off, too.  Continue checking every so often until you don't see them any more."
76161,t3_gq5bqg,i found this abandoned aloe vera in my parking lot and decided to take it back home. i watered it twice in 5 days because its soil have gotten completely dry. it looks very sick since the moment i brought it back home any help?,It needs good drainage and light!

312579,t3_tzxjdv,"I had my monstera for like 3 months and since I got it it had these brown spots, which have been spreading more since the last few weeks. These spots are now on the new leafs and there's also this white stuff on every leaf. Any tips on how to get the plant healthy again?","is there anything crawling on the underside of the leaves? it kinda looks like spider mites to me.
if so, isolate asap before it spreads to your other plants and honestly get a systemic in there. that’s the only way ive ever gotten rid of spider mites, with poison (do not use inside, do that outside)"

But the bottom leaves are browning &amp; yellowing— should I pluck them out? And is this a good time to put it into soil?","Yes you should pluck them. These plants cycle their leaves even in maturity. They’re just taking energy away from the plant at this point. 

I always wait until there’s A LOT (and I mean a lot) of roots to switch from water to soil- however I have never propagated a pilea this way. Good luck!"
312456,t3_tzlubs,Noticed my orchid leaves coming off and wasn’t sure what was normal. Here’s the roots. Help or recommendations?,"Rinse off all the old substrate. Remove any roots that are mushy, soft, or papery. Looks like your root system is mostly good, it's likely under watered. Use an orchid specific medium, usually bark chips, sphagnum moss, and sponge rock. Something that drains quickly. If you can fit it back into the same spot, do. Phalaenopsis like to be very snug in their pots. Water it by either running water through the pot or soaking for 20-30 minutes. Let the water drain fully, then don't water again until the pot is dry and the roots are silvery.  Good air movement is key to not giving these root rot.

I also suggest clipping the flower spikes off at this stage. This really needs to focus on root and leaf growth."
10580,t3_bmc9x1,My pink princess Philodendron has this thin spot on her new leaf that's not variegated but looks more like a burn or scar - should I worry about this?,That is a lot of water and a crazy amount of fertilizer.
71574,t3_gj5nmo,I’m new to indoor herbs. I planted seeds and have seedlings I recently potted. Some of them are starting to droop. I am not sure if I’m over or under watering??,"They're not getting enough light, so have stretched in search of it. This leaves them without enough strength to remain upright. In general, herbs need around eight hours of direct sunlight daily."
312290,t3_tz2swf,"its too dry in my office, so I gave it a humidifier, now it has mold. I officially dislike ferns. Is there anything I can do?","A delicate fern like that needs a lot of care. For mine I've made my own self watering pots out of cheap wick I bought on Amazon. I thread it through the drainage hole in the pot. Then I plant the fern in a soil mix of 1 part peat, 1 part vermiculite and 1 part perlite. Set the pot on a reservoir of water and the wick will draw up the perfect amount of water for the fern. 
I would cut off all the parts with mold. If it's bad you can cut off all the fronds. They should grow back from the roots in a couple months. 
What kind of light does it get there? When I've gotten mold it was a combo of humidity being too high and light being too low. I lowered the humidity and moved it to a window and it's fine now. Good luck!"
10542,t3_bm85gf,"I have the worst luck with Aloe. I repotted into a smaller container (next to it) about a week ago. Still looks the same, maybe even a little worse- more brown. When I repotted, I noticed there were almost no roots. I’ve had it for about a year. Should I just give up on this guy?","Nah aloe is very hardy! This one even has new growth in spite of its nasty sunburn. This baby needs WAY less direct light. Also a pruning to save its energy—remove a couple of the super droopy/dried out lower limbs (bet you can still propogate successfully from those). Did you pot with high-drainage soil (a cactus mix for instance)? If not, replace the soil &amp; once you’ve transitioned it to its new envoronment (light/soil) to start I’d suggest only watering once a month with a full soak. It should start plumping up &amp; then turn bright green soon. Good luck!"
76696,t3_gqzlrn,One leaf on my new monstera has black around the edges. I'm worried it’s some kind of leaf disease &amp; thinking of cutting it off. Any ideas?,"Don’t cut it off, the rest of the leaf is functional and will help it grow larger and make new leaves. 

Did it grow like that or did it unfurl green then turn dark?  What conditions is it kept in? Could be sunburn if the new leaf got too much direct sun when it first opened."

It had little growth and then just stopped. It’s been like this for more than half a year now. What’s going on?,How often do you water it? It looks a little thirsty
10294,t3_bld9r9,I was given this as a gift yesterday. It did not come with a care card. What is it and how do I take care of it?,"Kalanchoe - it’s a succulent, so plenty of sunlight and only water when it’s dry. Deadhead the flowers when they fade. I’m v bad about fertilizing so hopefully someone else can tell you if they need anything like that."
77127,t3_grlsd0,"A Monstera Mess!! This monstera went through a crazy shipping accident was in transit for over a month, it arrived a week ago and has not been doing well and leaves are not unfolding, any tips?","I would be careful with the water. Sometimes yellow leaves means it is overwatered. I know it might be instinct to water more since it’s been without water for a month but you don’t want to stress it out again. If that arial root that’s coming out of the pot is mushy and brown I would cut it off since it’s likely dead. Does it get direct sun by that window? Indirect is better for these guys since they can burn. 

Try to find a place with good indirect light and slow down on the watering. They don’t like to be sitting in wet soil. Best of luck!"

My succulents spend their time in cold windowsill through winter and they are almost fully without water for months, maybe watered max once or twice in winter.

What should I do to help?,"This is sun stress, not sunburn.  Sun stress, or stress coloration, is how the plant protects itself from sunburn, and it's a sign that the plant has sufficient light.  If the plant were all the light green at the top, that would be a sign that the plant needs more light (but it's normal for new leaves).  Many people deliberately cultivate stress coloration because it's pretty.

Should I remove the self watering item?,I would highly suggest removing the self watering item and either removing the top layer of soil where the mold has formed or just repotting the whole plant completely in new soil to make sure it doesn't come back. Maybe just stick to having a watering schedule where you let the soil dry out between waterings. Also if you really want to try self watering maybe look into hydrospikes instead or research wick watering. I feel like you would have better success with these methods.

Make sure you isolate it and check your other plants for signs.
343367,t3_wcfccz,So I just finished transplanting some of my plants into different pots with completely new soil. I saved all the old soil and mixed everything together then mixed in what remaining perlite I had and poured in 1 gallon of hot tap water to rehydrate the soil. Is this too much perlite?,Too much perlite for which plants? My Trichocereus cacti probably do great in that soil/perlite mix. Looks fine to me if your plants need good drainage.

I don’t see any yellowing spots (usual sign of overwatering) so that’s my theory.

39734,t3_e8i0d3,"Why? It has roots, left leave is all soft and seems rotten... Second is becoming the same 😭 too much water? Not enough?",Probably root rot - looks like you have it in a tin can? You really need some airflow/pours pot/drainage holes. What do you have it potted in?

Similar to a philodendron and sometimes sold under that name, but it’s actually epipremnum aureum. Pothos are amazingly hardy, but all plants need light. Does it have a lamp or other source of light during the day? Pothos prefer real sunlight but I’ve seen plenty of giant pothos plants thriving in offices! (You made a great choice.) 

As for watering, the best way to tell is when the top inch of soil is dried out—just stick your finger in up to the first joint. Pothos would rather be underwatered than overwatered, so if you’re in a super dry environment, I’d say once a week MAYBE, but definitely no more. Let the plant tell you when it’s thirsty! And make sure it’s in a pot with good drainage. When you water, drench it until water drips out the bottom drainage hole. This’ll also mean you get a good soak and can cut down on how often it needs to be watered."

Is the only way to fight it is to just cut off affected stems?","Hibiscus grows fast! I agree, those leaves you have remaining look unrecoverable unless you know that it is underwatered and that's why it looks like that.

You've only had it for 4 days so if you've watered more than once its overwatered

Rex begonias like bright light (check), good humidity and to dry out about half way between waterings. I know its time to water when the soil is dry and it has started to droop

If you arent slowly acclimating it to the window it may look sadder because of the sudden increase in light and temp. Back it off from the window and slowly adjust it by leaving it for longer and longer periods in the spot you want it in each day"

344340,t3_wf9do9,Too much water or not enough? He has lived in the same spot in the sunroom for two years. Why would this just start to happen?,"Hmmm, I think you'll need to do a bit more invesrigation to discover the source of the issue, it's not easy to tell just from a photo what the cause is.

If you haven't moved the plant in 2 years and assuming you haven't drastically changed your watering regime or recently repotted him it could be that your soil is depleted of nutrients. That could be fixed as easily as adding an appropriate fertilizer to your water jug the next time you water or it may mean you need to repot it with fresh soil.

First check the plant for any type of pest and signs thereof just to ensure that's not the issue.

Good luck!"

Keep it in total darkness for around 14 hours a day, for up to 6 weeks or so. No quickly switching on the light, it should be completely dark.

 If it works for this year, you should see minuscule buds appear within 4 weeks or so. When the buds have appeared and are swelling, you can stop the treatment."

""***Foliar nematodes:*** *Foliar nematodes are in the genus Aphelenchoides. The adult nematodes migrate in water films on the stems to the leaves of their host plant and penetrate the leaves through natural openings (stomata) (Figure 21). Once in the leaves the nematodes migrate, destructively feed, molt and lay eggs. The feeding activity of the nematodes causes characteristic interveinal chlorosis and necrosis of the leaf, ultimately killing it. The nematodes are able to move from leaf to leaf if the proper (moist) environmental conditions exist and can severely damage a plant. In the winter the adult nematodes persist in the dead leaves until favorable conditions arise in the spring. If the dead, nematode-infested leaves are moved or blown around this will help disperse the nematode near new host plants (Hesling and Wallace 1961).""*

You can do more research according to the plant type and what you are seeing.

Moss and succulents can’t thrive together and one will always die. If you water enough to keep the moss alive, you’ll kill the succulent. If you water too little, which is what the succulent wants, you’ll kill the moss. You are probably overwatering if there’s brown squishy bits on the leaves.

This is the gazillionth plant I've killed, so any help for my black thumb of death?","Sounds like your watering technique might be the culprit. Pretty much no plant wants frequent but light waterings. They want deep, thorough waterings but only when they've gotten thirsty. 

Don't water on a set schedule; *check* on a set schedule. Stick your finger down into the soil. If the top two inches of soil are dry (as in, not damp), then it's time to water. Take it out of the cache pot and set it in the sink or the shower, then thoroughly water until water is running out of the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. Leave it in the sink til it stops dripping, then put it back in the cache pot.

Depending on how much light it gets, what kind of plant it is, what season you're in, and how it feels at the time, the number of days between watering will vary, even for the same plant. 

There are some common house plant species that are exceptions to these ""rules"" (ferns like to stay moist, succulents like to stay dry), but this strategy will serve most houseplants and will be a good starting place for you to figure out what each one actually prefers.

Also, write down your plant names, maybe in a notes app on your phone. Most plant problems can be solved quickly with Google, but only if you know what to search.

So does that mean it’s time to repot with new soil? Is it not getting enough drainage?","This set-up is setting you to fail. While the outter pot is nice, it keep you from having a good eye on your watering. Ditch that pot and out a plate under it. I know the look isn't the same with a plate but having none is a huge mistake. You need to water your plant until water goes out and on the plate. How do you know there is excess water when you cannot see the bottom? In other words, how do you know you've given it enough water?

You don't, because of the outer pot.

Both your pots (if you decide to favor it to the inner, and if it has drainage holes) are of appropriate size for your plant.  1.5 litres of room temp water should do the trick every time it needs it (go for room temp water: water from the tap can be too cold and give a temp shock to the roots).

What should I do now?","It looks like it might be a type of kalanchoe. Maybe Longiflora. You can probably save it but you’ll want to repot it in a slightly larger pot, with good drainage. And in cactus soil and cut way back on watering. Keep it in bright indirect light if you can, by a sunny window inside. Outside it will do best in partial shade. 

If it is longiflora, the reddish coloration of the leaves is normal. 

It tolerates infrequent watering in the spring and summer but wants very little, to almost none in the winter, succulents all tolerate being too dry way better than too wet so when in doubt, let it dry out."

With freshly washed hands, gently use your supple fingertips to grasp and then remove the dead, dried foliage with light tugs, being sure to whisper loving nothing's to the plant like ""I'm sorry my bro done dried you up while I was gone, I still love you I swear Ill always come back for you"".


Then, after you have cleaned her up, to prevent any big splashing ropes of water, use some sort of nozzle tool to very slowly, drop by drip, saturate the water. The importance of making sure the flow of water is at a slow rate, as well as evenly distributed through out the plant container, cannot be understated! 

Then, go to a plant store and buy a mild, water soluble fertilzer. The box might say 5 5 5 on it. Follow the instructions on the box to give the plant a little meal to help boost it into a happy and fruitful life. 

Then, place it in a nice corner somewhere next to a window but being aware that it does not get direct sunlight but instead alot of indirect sunlight during the day. 

TLDR: WATER. this plant has life left in it indeed."

The gant larvas are like mosquitos, so they thrive in wet areas. You can change out the soil and only water your monstera once the soil is dry or you let it dry out and put a thick layer of fine sand on top of the soil, so the new gnats can escape from the soil and the already living ones can't lay new eggs.

Edit: sorry i read that wrong, you want to take your monstera out of the soil and purely in water right? 
You can do that, but that can mean a lot of stress for your plant. I would try with the method above (maybe order some nematodes to that, they eat the larva) and if this doesn't work, try to repot and wash her root carefully before that."

27588,t3_d00iwa,Help!! I found my cactus like this a few days ago after being away. Is it rot? What can I do to help?,"From the photo, it looks like overwatering has caused rot. 

What's your watering schedule like? Ideally, cacti shouldn't be on a schedule - they should be watered according to *need*, something discoverable by testing the soil for dryness. But as an estimate, for an indoor cactus, I'd imagine something along the lines of once a fortnight. 

The watering problem has probably been compounded by the soil. From the photo, your soil looks *much* too dense for cacti - it doesn't look well-draining, which is what cacti require. It's likely that when you've watered it - even if you've done so once every 2 weeks - the soil has retained too much moisture. Too much moisture results in rot, which results in discolouration and rot."

It probably cant get enough energy to the top of the stem after repotting.  Use a sterile blade and cut the stalk about 3-4 inches from the soil, then wait.

I find that my fly traps catch little tiny gnats enough on their own, so yours may not need much help with food. 

Don't trim leaves when they start to brown. Let them turn completely brown first. The plant is reabsorbing the green parts. Removing the leaf when it's still a little green will be taking nutrients away from the plant.

You can let your guy flower, but keep in mind that flowers take a lot of energy to make. I would advise removing any flowers that pop up until the plant has established itself really well. You may not even need to worry about flowers for a while.

I water it once every two weeks (sometimes longer) by pouring a little water into the top, then setting the whole pot on a little stand to allow extra water to drain out the bottom and not have the pot in standing water. 

The plant is on a table about 15 feet away from a northeast-ish facing window. It does not get any direct sunlight, but gets about 6 hours of indirect bright light per day

Since about May, the leaves have been gradually Browning and getting very crisp and dry. The brownness only seems to affect a particular leaf all at once (that is, the leaves that are not yet affected by the brownness have no brownness whatsoever). 

I'm thinking maybe it has something to do with the humidity in the air? I live in an apartment in the Northeast where heating is included, and until late April our heating was permanently on (we had it on low, but we couldn't turn it all the way off). We don't have a humidifier. 

Is there anything I can do? Should I repot? I have been cutting off the brown leaves once they are completely dry and crackly, but other leaves continue to brown."

What you need to do, is to cut away all the black (if it is rot), clean the roots and continue doing water changes. 

You can add a small amount of peroxide to the water, which will help with oxygenation. Personally, I would not fertilize if there is any sign of distress.

Sometimes these guys are very, very thirsty..."
56288,t3_fofgja,My spider plant is wilted after being shipped to me. 4 days later he’s still like this. What should I do?,"I got you! 

These guys can absolutely have direct sunlight. In fact, offset production and foliage shape (meaning the lift from the base and not being droopy) is directly related to light exposure. While I wouldn't give it all day direct sun, it will absolutely benefit from a few hours of morning and late afternoon direct light. 

When transplanting, especially to a larger pot, it's best to not drench the entire soil with water. Know where your roots are and primarily water that spot. This will help to make up for the extra space in the pot because the dry soil at the edges will help the wet soil to effectively dry and not keep the roots wet for too long. If there's any chance that this soil is overly compacted or too saturated, I would dump it out asap and resolve that. 

I disagree that one should wait two weeks to repot. (There are a lot of weird myths that get spread around the plant subs.) There's no rule about that at all. In fact, if there's any sort of issue when your plant arrives, it's prudent to repot asap so as to not keep the roots in a bad situation, which would just make things worse. Waiting two weeks is just ridiculous. (edit: Also, physiologically, this just doesn't even make sense.)

Otherwise, after this, just water when the soil is completely dry and avoid any tap water that contains fluoride. They're super sensitive to fluoride toxicity. 

Best of luck!"

I wish you the best of luck with this one. Isolate and inspect every one of your plants you see these guys on, especially on the stems and along the vascular systems. Then spray all of the infected plants every three days for at least two weeks with the strongest insecticide your local garden center has - I can only recommend Safer's EndAll if you live in Canada, I'm not sure what's available elsewhere. Thrips reproduce very quickly, so it is important to spray repeatedly to kill them at every stage of their lifecycle.

I’m getting a lot of yellow fruit as well though, and yellow leaves especially closer to the container. I wouldn’t think it’s overwatering since it’s a self watering container and we haven’t had a ton of rain lately, could it be letting the reservoir get too low? Or is it maybe roots not having enough space ?"
47170,t3_f0f4r8,"Money Tree leaves starting to decay/yellow. I saw 2 small bugs with wings near the soil, very small, but I don't see anymore.

So I assume not overwatering, and also I have not had any issues with underwatering on any plants before so I don't think it is that.

Both plants were moved about 2 weeks ago to a new location in my kitchen, more sun time but less direct.

Newly purchased FLF placed near them (1 week ago), and the FLF has some damaged leaves where they are dark/some crispy spots. Possibly something spread from that to the Money Tree/Aglaonema? 

No other bugs spotted/fungus/growth. No pictures of the bug unfortunately because in distress I killed them..."

333622,t3_vlb2rq,"Inherited jade plant is melting away. It was dying when I got it, so I tried repotting, but that only seems to have made it worse. Is this salvageable?",It should be salvageable! I would start by removing the melted stems. Any drooping stems that seem somewhat salvageable can be propitiated. What was the soil like when you got it? Crassuala usually do best in high draining soils. I keep mine in terracotta pots as they are more breathable and I let the soil completely dry in between waterings.

It will go dormant and take time to regenerate new leaves before it blooms again. Orchids are beautiful, but requires a lot of patience."

I did months of experimenting with growing different plants in orbeez just for giggles, I’ve been gardening for like 10 yrs and sometimes you just get bored 😭 anyway ... long story short every single one of them died. Idk why since the orbeez are like mostly water and I’m almost sure non toxic, but they just didn’t vibe I guess. I tried different nutrient solutions and all sorts of different genus/species and everyone died lol. So I’d recommend taking it out, but tbh the stem looks kinda rough so I’m not sure the condition, but check the roots for rot and if they look good you should be able to get it back just in a different substrate lmao"

So are they bad for plants or not?","They can supposedly eat baby growth and small roots, but I've never lost anything to them. They can also be a sign of too much watering if they're always there, which would lead to yellow leaves and slower growth. I used to have them everywhere until I started letting my plants dry out fully in between watering."

Over- or under-watering?","Rosemary is tricky indoors. As with lavender, they want to be outside.

No drainage hole? Super bad. Rosemary likes a quick draining soil. Not only does it need a drainage hole, it needs a quick draining soil mix.

Watering everyday? No, water thoroughly right when the soil becomes dry. 

Filtered sun? No, it needs as much as it can get as in an unobstructed south facing window."

It's very normal for alocasias to have only a few leaves at a time, and for older leaves to wilt and die as new leaves come out. They're very tough to keep happy for extended periods of time, so you're doing great."

It's likely too late into winter now, but I'd reccomend planting them in your garden outside in spring if you have one. They're very cold hardy and can more than withstand Irish winter temps outside, but if plunked out into them now without having acclimated the probably will be killed. If you are in an apartment, and have a balcony, a planter out there would do fine too, but it has to be of a decent size or the roots might freeze too hard."

How do I save my pothos?","Was it yellowing before you repotted it? Yellowing typically means too much water or root damage. Did you inspect the roots when you moved it? Does that pot have a hole in it? 

For now I’d suggest putting it in indirect light and just leaving it alone for a few weeks. Maybe clip back the vines and drop those into some water to prop some new roots. If it continues to decline rapidly, I’d take it out of the pot, gently knock all the dirt off and check for root rot. Trim off any mushy or black parts and pot back into fresh soil mix.

 You can try propagating, but aloe does not propagate from leaf cuttings very easily. I would salvage all the healthy gel and freeze it for future use, and start over with a new plant.

For future reference, get yourself some GNATROL. Nothing works better and eradicates every last one of those t%#$%!!

**THE** most effective solution is to eradicate in the soil at the larvae level. You need to DRENCH the soil.

GNATROL WDG (Biological Larvicide): [https://nufarm.com/usturf/product/gnatrol-wdg/](https://nufarm.com/usturf/product/gnatrol-wdg/)

Gnatrol is 100% safe for all plants and all other insect life, except fungus gnats. Accidentally used 3 tablespoons instead of 3 teaspoons per gallon, on a row of succulents in my greenhouse and didn't harm a single leaf, but assuredly eradicated every single gnat.

Are they able to be saved??,"I've had these succulents in a mixture of normal potting soil, coco coir, perlite and pumice. I've had them since 2021 and am clueless about how to care for them 🙈 I bought them when I just got interested in indoor plants. Originally I used tap water to water all my plants but they started forming a white residue around the inner edge of the pots and at the bottom. I guess that the water in Korea is too hard (we, expats, struggle with skin, scalp and hair issues because of the water quality in this country) so I started using distilled water. 

All my plants are under grow lights, since maybe 4 months ago. I only realized this evening that these plants haven't grown since I've gotten them, in fact the sanserveria trifasciata suffered greatly from overwatering at one stage and most of the plant slowly died off. What's left is what survived the overwatering issue. 

I hope that they're not beyond saving 😔 all your help will be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance"

Find a very small glass container even something like a shot glass will work. Cut off just the Brown part at the bottom of this , place it in to the glass container (cut side down and standing up) you chose and maintain a water level of around 3mm. This could possibly grow roots.

If it's growing very slowly and leaves are small it could be an indication that the plant needs more light. You may want to leave it where it is and just place a grow light over it because some ficus can be bratty about moving. If you haven't fertilized in a while, you may want to do that as well."

I’m watering this about 2-3 times a week, or when it looks dry. And it’s next to a humidifier. What am I doing wrong?!?","Definitely watering 2-3 times a week is too much for succulent. They store water in their leaves and stems. And pot seems too big for your plant. It also makes soil more wet. If i were you, i’ll repot it in much smaller pot.

Looks like overwatering to me, usually the browing tips like that mean over watering. General yellowing and splotchy brown seems to be underwatering more often. The soil should be dry to the touch between waterings but not dry for a long time. You could pull it out of the pot and check if the roots are mushy. Remove any mushy roots and repot.

Any ideas?","They're not growing, they're etiolating - stretching to reach out for more light somewhere, though it might look like growth. Succulents need bright, direct light, so it likely wasn't getting enough light after being re-potted. Also, the soil looks too organic, and the pot is way too big for small succulents like that, so the soil was likely retaining too much water, hence the root rot; lack of light would also make that worse (ie. less light = less photosynthesis = less water being used up = more water in the soil for root rot), and so would putting rocks at the bottom of the pot; a drainage hole would be better for drainage than rocks."

Also hoyas, unlike many other plants, can and will develop roots all along the stem where there are little tiny bumps that are ""adventitious roots"".  The roots don't have to come from a node.  So sticking the stem in water is fine.

Keep an eye on it and if you seen no roots in about 6 weeks, then consider a different rooting method.  Plenty of other choices.  You'll do fine!  You have a huge vine there that could be cut into multiple pieces to root."

I use horticultural charcoal, pumice and crushed gravel in a 70% ratio to my base organic potting mixture (because soil is too rich) and also use terra cotta pots to help wick additional moisture out quickly. Once rot starts, it can't be undone. *IF* this is an overwatering issue, those rotten spots are not a good sign. Switch to a well draining, mainly inorganic mixture. Water.. hardly ever, lol.

SOURCE = And You will want to treat the source, which is too much available moisture...reduce any standing moisture under pots in pot water catchers or trays &amp; remove any fallen leaves/debris from inside your pots...and you’ll want to cut back on your watering frequency for a bit...I know some plants love moisture/humidity..and another technique I’ve seen used is to clear out leaves/debris, and put a thin layer of the smallest possible mesh of steel wool..you want to shape the steel wool so that it covers the soil and even comes up the edge of the pot a little, then you can place river rocks on top...thereby creating a barrier between the moist soil and outside air..and any fungus gnats already in the soil will get trapped below the tiny mesh steel wool..any adult gnats will also be unable to get down passed the steel wool to the soil in order to lay eggs...I’m sure there are YouTube videos showing ‘how to’...this corrects the source of the issue..

TREATMENT = 
Other General treatment(s) for the issue, such as using fungicide &amp; insecticide tends to work...there are various options like:
1) HORTICULTURE OIL (Neem Oil, Etc; however, these can be harsh and even burn or kill plants if used in too high a concentration)..

2) BTI = some people even use mosquito dunks (misquote dunks left to float in the water container used to water the plants, as mosquito dunks contain BTI (see below), which is reportedly not harmful to humans or domestic animals...However, if you want an “Organic” solution (some say BTI is one, as is a natural organism, yet opinions differ)...

3) ENZYMES = Dr Zymes offers an enzyme solution that is OMRI certified on doctorzymes.com called the “Eliminator” supposedly it won’t hurt your plants &amp; can be used up to the day of harvest (heads up though it ain’t cheap)....you’re supposed to use it as a treatment at night (or when your grow lights are off) as the sunlight/grow light, kills the enzymes..anyways, check it out &amp; decide...

“BTI = Bacillus thuringiensis serotype israelensis is a group of bacteria used as biological control agents for larvae stages of certain dipterans. Bti produces toxins which are effective in killing various species of mosquitoes, fungus gnats, and blackflies, while having almost no effect on other organisms.”

EXISTING GNATS =
A mason jar with a solution of:
Dish soap (couple drops)+either White or Apple Cider Vinegar (couple table spoons)+a little bit of water - 1/4 cup or less)..I’ve heard of someone also adding a few drops of essential oil in the mix just to make it smell better to human noses...&amp; I think she even left out the vinegar, but can’t recall..

with Plastic Wrap Placed over the mouth of the jar, and rubber banded or tapped in place, and a couple toothpick sized holes punched in the top (the idea is to allow them to fly or crawl in, but not enough holes to make it easy for them to find their way back out again), the dish soap kills them and the vinegar draws them...Place it by the plant or moisture source or even by/under the only light in the room ...the gnats being attracted to the light+moisture...enter the trap, get stuck and die in the soap/solution...

Or is it dead?,This looks like a peperomia I don’t know though.  The apps are good if you have found a schedule.  But before you water with a reminder it would be good to stick your finger in the soil.  Make sure it is dry down below.  I think peperomias are more succulent like or drought resistant.  They store water in their leaves. So drying out in between watering would be good.  Also I don’t think it is dead but not happy.  You can try to get it dry or replace with fresh soil.

I repotted one of my african masks about 6 weeks ago into a 4"" pot. I just had to repot it the other day into a 6"" pot because it had filled the 4"" pot with roots that were starting to grow out of the bottom. It's starting to push out a new leaf now, 3 days after being repotted."

Additional details: I bought the plant about 6 months ago, it had flowers that appeared shortly after purchase but I cut them before blossoming. I have harvested and pruned the basil a few times, but obviously not for a while. 

It was in the stupid plastic 2 oe 3 inch pot until 4 days ago when I repotted it. Now it's in a clay or ceramic pot that is porous so water can drip out the bottom. (Can water be sucked up from the bottom like a reservoir?)

I water it from top down. Watered it when I repotted it and then waited 2 days before watering it again yesterday. Today no water since the top is still moist. If I take the top of the pot off, the basin just has about 3 or 4 drips of water, so it doesn't seem excessive but I dunno it's basil and I obviously don't know what I'm doing.

162481,t3_kqe32w,Monstera has brown flaky texture over large portions of leaves—anyone know why this is happening and how to help?,"Good morning /r/Plantclinic and thank you in advance for any ideas to help my monstera!

He has a little bit of browning/scorching on a couple of leaves from a brief stint outside with some direct light (we’re in San Diego, CA); I have since moved him indoors right next to a big north facing window that gets good bright light (I think? I don’t have a photometer and I’m relatively new to plant care)

What I’m concerned and confused by is this brown flaky texture I’m seeing covering large portions of several big leaves. The bigger flake bits are not moving and are definitely not insects—it seems to flake off in these little bits (but the brown texture is consistent). 

I brought him home in June and potted him into this pot about a week later, using a mix of potting soil and orchid bark. The pot has a drainage hole and I use a water meter to water him when the soil is fully dry. I use tap water and when we clean the aquariums he gets aquarium water (for that yummy fish poop nutrition!) I also mist him when I water. 

This texture began appearing probably 2-3 months ago and has spread. He did spend the month of December in somewhat lower light when the Christmas tree took over his usual window spot, so he was about 7 ft away from the window. 

Any thoughts on what the brown texture is and how to help my monstera out are greatly appreciated by us both!"

It also might be a little crowded with the other plants in there even if that’s how you got it, they look really nice when you buy them but at some point some can outgrow being put together.

Mine do this when I propagate cuttings - no growth for several months as the root system matures then one day BOOM they start growing (and can't be stopped).  Usually I will lose a cutting or two along the way.  All this to say, at first glance and reading your description, it sounds very normal but if you are worried, you can always (gently) pull the plant from the pot and remove some soil to make sure the roots are not rotting."

The ideal grow conditions are similar but I do find the ctenanthes prefer a bit more shade (more than bright indirect and I find they burn, I solved this issue by moving from sill to about 5ft from window). Keep soil moist, don’t let it dry out too often. The yellow can indicate over-watering even with no root rot present. You won’t save what’s already yellowed or the tips, but these are a less temperamental than calatheas with humidity so with some steadier (potentially lighter) watering you may see some improvement."

(Millipedes have two pairs per segment.) 

Centipedes are predators, carnivores, not plant eaters.  They aren't hurting your plants, though they may be feeding on something that is.  If your plants aren't doing well, it may be time to repot with fresh potting mix, giving you a chance to examine for root health and any kind of infestation in the pots."

Do I need a taller moss pole to help the leaves growing outward?,"There is probably more than one plant there, but you'd have to get into the roots to find out. They cohabitate decently, but if you got more than two in there they're going to need frequent repotting/fresh soil, as they will get pretty root bound. If you are wanting to separate them, I'd do it sooner rather than later, as the roots will be harder to untangle the longer it goes. Propping is up to you, yay more plants (and they're pretty easy to prop), but it'll take some time for it to get going again (both mother and props). I'd highly recommend making sure any props have a good couple inches of root if you do, and I've found my props with at least two nodes do better, three or more is even more optimal and you'll usually have some good roots on a couple nodes already as well. Your pole is fine, more than fine really. You want to be tying the actual vine (where the nodes/aerial roots are) to the pole, not the leaf stems, especially not the latest least stem, as they bruise easily, and can cause permanent damage to the next leaf while it's developing. So you'd only be tying down around the base of the plant for now, no where near the top of the pole."

This plant naturally wants to grow as just a single vine, and the growing tip sends chemicals back down the plant to tell the lower buds not to grow.

Any tips for making it happy?,"they are super easy- once it’s happy it should grow like there’s no tomorrow :) place it in bright indirect light, if you’re in the northern hemisphere a north facing window or maybe east would be best, and only water it when the soil has dried."

168001,t3_l02run,My Aglaonema Siam Aurora has been churning out really striking but oddly colored leaves including one that is mostly now yellow and some that have a plantinum hue. Should I be worried? Is it normal ? I have it placed next to window that receives mild morning sunlight. Is she ok ?,I’m not certain about aglaonema specifically but a lot of variegated plants will grow more green leaves in low light and more variegated leaves in stronger light. It’s possible that it’s just happy and getting plenty of sun so it feels safe enough to churn out these less efficient leaves.
167979,t3_l01r4o,found this on the ground outside while running! can anyone tell me what it is and more importantly how to make it happy?,"Likely an Amaryllis, and if so, it is done for the year.  It is not a year round houseplant."

What to do?",Was the soil dry when you watered it?
167824,t3_kzuoun,Help! My hoya pubicalyx is looking pretty sad. Should I water even though it's winter and I've heard some hoyas don't want to be watered at all?,This hoya and the size pot needs to be watered about once a week give or take. Some hoyas need a lot less water than pubicalyx but maybe you're thinking of how cactuses that don't want or any water in the winter?
167475,t3_kza4fr,"Orchid rescue, i just got this discounted orchid, i have zero experience with plants, can this be saved? And how best to care for it?","Yes, I would recommend also the subreddit for orchids because they are very fussy! 

Personally, I’d remove and not recommend the ice because it can freeze and kill the air roots. It looks like you have some green in the roots which is good, they don’t like cold drafts and they like bright indirect light."

Doesn't look like thrips damage, right?","So sorry for the typo. It's supposed to mean ""when I got it"" ofc. My plant had the spots on several leaves when I got it, they all became brighter with more contrast. I have never had this before! I appreciate your experiences"

268149,t3_q4wndn,"Is my heartleaf ok? It was drenched when I got it, but I didn’t realized because it had a layer of moss on top. It sat about a week before I repotted in 1:1:1 potting soil, perlite, orchid mix. I put it outside to get some bright indirect light. Is this leftover spots from over watering? Sunburn?",Looks like overwatering and I think I see some thrips too 😬
166973,t3_kyigd2,Asparagus fern is turning yellow :( i dont know whats wrong. Its in a terrakotta pot close to a south facing window. I dont Think its overwatered since it usually dries out quickly. What should i do? Cut the brown parts and soak it with water?,As far as I know they do not like to dry out. I think you probably underwatered it. Terracotta causes soil to dry out more quickly so I would probably repot it into a different pot and cut off everything that is dead.

Also to be honest though I had an alright watering schedule, I could've been a lot more educated about their care. Anyone have any advice for helping these guys heal and good care schedules for orchids?","# 1 is fully dead, sorry. #2 may recover if the growth point is intact. It is extremely dehydrated though. Check out r/orchids for care info"
267632,t3_q3ptki,I’m concerned about the leaves colouring. It is paler than before. Is something wrong? What can I do?,"New leaves are always more pale in color until they have time to soak up chlorophyll after unfurling. Otherwise, pale leaves could signify your plant's desire for more light but (especially with Geoppertia/Calathea/whatever the funk you call it) this could also be a symptom of inconsistent watering. By inconsistent watering I mean not maintaining proper soil moisture constantly (like letting it get too dry then watering, just an example) and will throw fits when they don't get what they need with a precision."
169765,t3_l367je,Struggling to properly care for tropical plants without overwatering them or drying them out. Did the edges of my philodendron Xanadu dry out because of too little moisture? Or is the yellowing from too much moisture?,"In an effort to counteract crispy edges, I’ve started to water when the very top layer of the pot is dry, but there is still some moisture. But I think I may be overdoing it because now I have some yellowing leaves."

170537,t3_l4iac4,Trying to save my African violet. I had fungus gnats and got rid of them but they seem to have come back. Any tips on how to save him?,"Bottom water! Fungal gnats like wet top soil so watering from below allows the top soil to remain dry and they won’t lay eggs. I water my African violet every couple weeks when the soil is pretty much dry (dry/soak method) and the leaves are drooping. This method is great because AV don’t like their leaves to get wet at all. The fungal gnats won’t harm the plant, they are more a nuisance to us! Hope this helps!"
170425,t3_l4awsc,"Purchased these yesterday. Snake plant soil is pretty soggy, do I let it dry out completely and see how things go? Cordyline has really healthy roots but is drooping and has some spotted leaves. Any tips on what I can do to help these guys further?",That’s a beautiful snake plant! They don’t like moisture so let the soil dry out before watering again (usual watering frequency is once every 2-6 weeks depending on the season). When you water check the first inch of soil is completely dry and try to avoid spilling any water onto the leaves or they could rot.
170003,t3_l3kac1,"My philodendron (I dunno what kind, it was gifted to me) grew too heavy on one side and he’s leaning against the pot. Should I leave him be? Try to re-pot him more straight?",Is the light source over that way? Looks like it is reaching
169996,t3_l3jzop,HELP! I got my neon pothos two weeks ago and watered only once from the bottom. It now has translucent leaves and now has developed brown spots as dots. What should I do?? Will it live?,It seems as if it was slightly overwatered. Was the soil completely dry before you watered ? I’m pretty sure it will live but you should check the roots &amp; make sure there’s not rot.
169775,t3_l37wvk,"Are these spider mites on my palm or some other critter? I know they are alive because I see them moving... I have a neem oil spray I can use, but are there any other tips for preventing/getting rid of whatever these are?","Those look like mites and mites love palms! I would use neem, but there are lots of other things you can do as well. You can spray the entire thing down very very thoroughly with soapy water, get every leaf top and bottom, every stalk, everything. Then spray down with an insecticide that targets mites (there are various options - Captain Jack’s is popular). Neem I believe can take multiple applications/time to work so I would combine these methods. Neem stinks imo so I’d do it in a bathroom with a fan or outside. Same with insecticide sprays. 

I *think* I’ve tackled a big mite infestation in about 1/3-1/4 of my plants, including a big palm, and that’s what I did."
169615,t3_l2vyoz,Help! I saw this in the soil of my fiddle leaf fig and I’ve never seen anything like this before. Any idea of what this is?,"It’s a harmless fungus. You can just remove it, the plant should be totally fine."

169390,t3_l2ixoh,A friend gave me this snake plant 3 weeks ago but I noticed that the leaves are folded and some are curling. It’s placed indoors and receives low light. What should I do?,"The curled leaves and wrinkles mean that your plant is thirsty. If you haven't already, give it some water. Also, while snake plants are known to be low light tolerant plants, they thrive medium to bright indirecligaight."

267305,t3_q2xxsu,We have a bunch of these winged gnat looking bugs infesting our plumeria we brought home from Hawaii. What do we do??,"They are probably fungus gnats. They make sticky traps, mosquito biscuit tea. and systemic granules. 
The faster you want to get rid of them the more solutions you should do at the same time. 
They don’t harm anything but they’re a pain.
You can also do vinegar soap mixture sit out in cups"
168974,t3_l1qqu4,"Just got this one today! I’m not well informed but I believe it’s root bound? Should I replant and if so, what size do i put it in?","Looks root bound to me!

I can’t tell how many inches the current pot is, but depending on the severity 1-2 inches larger."

Could it just be that it needs water and fertilizer?,"Yes, this happens from both underwatering and overwatering. Generally, they can be watered once the soil has dried and the tips of the foliage just begin to droop. Don't let them go longer than this though."

Since then, the plant has been droopy and infested with gnats. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do?",It looks a bit leggy. Isn't the soil too wet/airy enough?

240859,t3_oouf1p,"Plant parents of Reddit, with growth my Aloe Vera fell sideways and lost her roots 😭 Is there anything I can do to save her??",If it's otherwise healthy you should be able to just wait for the break to callus (will take a day or 2) and then pop it in well draining soil and it will root itself. If you have it you can dip the end in some rooting hormone. Luckily succulents are usually pretty easy to propagate!

Not repotted but needs to be - it's putting out a lot of roots and outgrowing its home swiftly. However no actual health issues with the roots as far as I can see. Pot is plastic, has drainage holes.

Potting mix is some bark and coir and a commercial soil/perlite mix. Pretty well draining. I water when just dry. Over winter I didn't water much at all and it seemed pretty happy. Started to water slightly more often as it's growing season but still not while damp. I water from the top with brita filtered water (my tap water is hard).

It is in a north/west facing bay window with lots of indirect light in the afternoon. It gets brighter light from the west in the evening. It is always indoors. 

Humidity is around 70. I'm in Northen England."

I suspect it has something to do with the humidity. Ferns require a constant high humidity, and can get very upset very quickly.

It's lasted many years in the desert heat with no issues. This has happened in about a weeks worth of time. Will it live?,"I know this sounds weird, but hold off on watering a lot for now. These leaves are gone, they won't come back and will fall off soon. I've seen this happen when I've missed watering for a day or two. It happens that fast. Chances are it will put on new leaves within a week or so. If you keep putting tons of water on it that it can't use it may damage the roots.

Citrus are one of those trees that like their soil to be very well draining, but are not particularly drought tolerant. They don't really have good storage for water like a succulent.

Do I cut the burnt bits?,"I hope you didn’t pay a lot for it. You can cut the burnt bits and hope for new growth in the middle. But that’s about it. The leaves with damage won’t become normal or fix themselves and will eventually need to be removed. I do see one small section of new growth peeking out the very front, so it’s not totally lost. But you will have to be very patient with it before it starts to look ok again."

204157,t3_muiwjc,Left for a long weekend and came back to what looked like big bites on the top of the leaf. I’ve had a gnat issue could that be what caused the brown/yellowing? Aside from slowly but surely getting rid of these gnats is there anything I should do for that spot?,"I'd suggest it is the result of improper watering. Fungus gnats are a strong indicator of over-watering and that in turn can lead to infection which is why you have the door with the yellow outer ring. I also see this a lot on Monsteras when people are""misting"" them. Spraying water isn't mist and really make no significant difference in terms of humidity and sadly often leads to this problem because the water spraying on the leaves spreads infection. Adult fungus gnats after not interested in attacking the foliage but of course their larvae is in the soil and gnats can go to town on roots of young plants or cuttings.If you've repotted in completely fresh soil then you're on track to get rid of the gnats as you've removed the larvae infested soil which will break the cycle, I always recommend the windows stickers supermarkets sell for fruit flies to deal with remaining adults, they are very cheap and highly effective. I strongly suspect this is due to watering rather than say a virus so if that is corrected the spots with yellow rings should stop, that leaf won't recover so you can cut off that little section if you wish but I personally wouldn't cut the whole leaf off unless the spots start spreading and you start getting more through that leaf, in which case do cut it off or it could spread through the plant. I water mine when they top few inches are dry, watering thoroughly until it puts through the drainage holes, removing any excess in the drip tray after 10 minutes. The water should follow through quite easily, if it isn't then it's may be that your soil is too heavy rather than too much water. You can add some perlite or other organic material to help with drainage or look for a soil mix specific to Monstera/Philodendron - I use the soil mixes from Soil Ninja and cannot recommend them highly enough."

Any ideas of what’s wrong or what we can do to ensure healthy growth?,"The first one is stretching out because it's not getting enough light. However, it looks like the epicuticular wax or farina has been wiped off. That protects the plant from sun scorch when it's in direct sun, from humidity and bruising. It doesn't come back once it's gone so the plant will be extra sensitive. New leaves will have farina but old leaves only make very small amounts, not enough to replace what was lost"

Is it salvageable?","Everything the other response said, plus stick your finger down into the soil to make sure it’s getting watered evenly. 

Pothos are hard to overwater. Any pothos with a node (where the leaf meets the stem) is salvageable. The little nubs along nodes of healthy stems will grow into new roots and start a whole new plant if you cut a piece off and put it in a glass of water.

Sometimes the top dries out and becomes hydrophobic. Water just rolls down the sides of the pot, leaving the roots dry, but the bottom full. If that’s the case, water slower, fluff up the top layer and be sure water is sinking in evenly."

Also, she has been putting out some not completely healthy leafs lately. Can this be connected to the fungi?","It's fine. Potting soil these days often contains ""forest products,"" such as ""slash"" (bark and other material that would otherwise be wasted when trees are cut for timber or pulp). They normally don't let it compost long enough, so sometimes it's a little ""hot"" going into the bag. Fungi grow on it, same as in the wild. Your plant is fine. If you don't like it, you can let it dry out a bit more between waterings.

As for the leaves- are you adding a bit of fertilizer every 2-3 weeks? Or you could add (say) 1/10th label strength fertilizer with every watering. Even then, leaves are not immortal, and they eventually senesce. The plant withdraws the nutrients before abscising the leaf, and they sometimes turn funny colors- often (but not always) moreso if it's running low on nutrients."

What is the potting mix like? And how long has it been since you last repotted? How do the roots look? What is the humidity like? And if the roots and long gone, are there any new growths on the way that will make new roots? The plant is cool-growing, and likes water, but also doesn't want to be completely soggy, in my experience (using sphagnum moss and repotting every year for sphagnum) is that when the top of the moss is just a tad ""crunchy"", I water it. I use clear pots too, so I can see how the roots are doing (green if wet, white-ish if dry). Orchids do like VERY dilute fertiliser (I always dilute it more than recommended), and I fertilise 3 waterings, and then flush with pure rain/de-ionised/RO water on the 4th watering! Too much salts in the water can also cause leaf-tip dieback.

Give enough water to reach the entire root system, not just the top layers of soil, but make sure the pot has a drainage hole so that the soil doesn't get water logged"
210522,t3_n5pwct,are these dracaena roots healthy? thought i had root rot because maybe 20% of the leaves in bottom leaves have been turning yellow and brown suddenly. could i be underwatering? or something else?,"Roots are looking healthy. Maybe you can repot your plant so it will get new soil and nutritions.

Your plant is healthy if it’s still growing. Don’t worry if it’s dripping the bottom leaves - I think is normal at Dracena."
210755,t3_n671vq,Newest fiddle leaf fig leaf is weirdly spotty- no issues on any other leaf. Does anyone know what’s wrong?,It’s edema. Happens when it is overwatered. As it matures the spots will go away.

It's now developing dark spots on the edges of its leaves and all the bottom leaves are drooping, unsure if I need to re-pot?","Droopy leaves means it needs some water. It's probably also stressed from lack the lack of water. If you're not consistently watering flf they will get edema, small brown spots on the new leaves. I wouldn't repot again as it would stress out the plant, but if you're desperate for gnat control that is one method that can help. Make sure you're using fresh soil in that case!

A lot of pest control is consistency, as is flf care. Don't let the soil stay dry for long, water when the leaves are drooping. Use the hydrogen peroxide mix to flush the soil when watering -but make sure you're not using too much peroxide in the mixture. I believe it's 1:3 that's safe for plants. Leave sticky traps up to get stragglers. I found neem oil to be very effective for controlling gnats as well as other pests, so that's also something you can look into. Good luck!"

If you’re sure the big main branch is dead on top, I would suggest cutting it back. I’m not sure what stuff you have laying inside the pot, but that should also be removed. Citrus trees like to have a few of their roots exposed on top and right now it looks like they’re being completely covered. Next, make sure it’s in a good quality, fast draining soil. Nurseries usually carry soil mixes especially for citrus trees. I’d also suggest finding a citrus friendly fertilizer at your local nursery, something rich in nitrogen. 

It also looks like there’s some sort of insect chomping on the leaves. I’m not sure what it is based on the bite marks alone, but an organic insecticide would probably do the trick. 

I hope that helps!"

I haven’t watered her in a month and the sticky traps(I’ve gone through several in the past few weeks) are still catching a ton of gnats. What should I do?,"1. Make sure you are letting your plants dry out a bit between waterings. 
2. My recommendation for getting rid of the larvae is a product called Mosquito Bits. It contains a natural bacteria that is toxic to the larva and harmless to everything else. You add it to the soil and water normally. 
3. The adults will not be impacted by mosquito bits. You will want to have sticky traps to catch the adults. Repeat these steps a few times because there will be eggs in various stages of development. You won't get them all the first round.

Another route you could take if you're truly desperate is, before doing the above, scoop out the first 1"" of soil from each pot and microwave it (you have to add water to help it heat more evenly). Google sterilizing soil. I believe the temperature you're looking for is 180F. Obviously let it cool before adding it back to your plants. This will kill off a nice amount of your larvae if you really feel you have an overwhelming infestation. My personal experience is that I found that sterilized soil seems to compact more easily, so it's not an ideal treatment but it gets the job done.

Keep in mind, that gnats are mostly an annoyance. They have to be in pretty significant quantities or be with a particularly fragile plant to cause much damage."

Gently loosen the existing root ball to aerate and encourage new root spreading, but do not overly expose/clean off roots, this can shock and stress the plant for no reason.  Completely soak the new pot initially the first 1-3 days then let it dry out over the next week or two and begin regular watering.

I'm going to paste here my guide on the soap treatment, even though you may be familiar with it, won't hurt.

___

How to get rid of spider mites in house plants.

You'll need: 
1 clean spray bottle—preferably brand new
Filtered/bottled water
Mild soap (I use scent free, gentle Dawn, Dr bronners is safer but more expensive)

Ballpark measurements: 2tbs of soap for 1 gallon of water

Mix the mild soap and clean water well, shake lightly, no need to foam up. Spray all leaves and stem surfaces until they are dripping wet and the solution is running over the leaf surfaces. Be very thorough. If you miss a few, the mites will reproduce and the infestation will return. One application is usually enough if you are really thorough.

Let the solution sit on the sprayed leaves for up to 2-3 hours. Rinse the sprayed leaves with cool, clean water.

Tips:
Cover the soil w kitchen plastic wrap before treatment to prevent the soil from getting soapy water.
Do not use soap with antibiotics or strong scents.
Patch test solution on smaller leaves for extra safety net.
You can use two spray bottles, one for applying the solution and another one with just water for the rinsing.

Pro tip:
If you live in a humid area, wipe the leaves dry to prevent water pooling and potential bacteria/fungus issues.

Discard solution afterwards, do not use old solution later on, make a fresh batch for each treatment, same spray bottle is fine, just rinse between usage and mark it as such."

I would just add fresh soil in a bigger pot, approximately 2-3” around the existing root ball and plant it. The brown roots are aerial roots, they look normal.

Root rot feels mushy and the roots slide right off leaving a center fiber. This isn’t it.

Messing with the roots/damaging them would stress the plant out for a week or two. If you want to, you could try to untangle a bit of the roots at the bottom of the root ball with your fingers.

121719,t3_imocgl,I treated my string of turtles for spidermites and I succeeded... but now the leaves are rotting. Overwatering from the hose spray down? The vinegar I used to treat the mites?,"Awe, poor turtle babies! Did you leave it in direct or strong sunlight while the leaves were wet? If so, maybe that did it. I have never used vinegar to treat for spider mites (glad it worked for you!!!), so I can’t speak for that. If it did get a lot of sun while wet, just leave it alone, shed a tear if needed while the damaged turtles shrivel up and die, and await the new healthy growth!!! My method to taking care of my plants is to not beat myself up and just learn from my mistakes. I’ve burned my string of turtles before and they forgave me 😄"
292362,t3_s8h1si,My oxalis leaves are closed even though it’s daytime and there’s plenty of sun - could it be too much sun that’s causing them to close and droop?,"It looks awfully droopy, what season is it where you live? Oxalis do go dormant for a bit and can end up looking like this when dormancy hits."
292366,t3_s8h982,"Hi everyone, mom's palm has these white stuff all over the leaves. It sits indoor and doesn't get much sun. What is this?","Likely insects. It's hard to tell because the camera isn't really focused. Use a rubbing alcohol solution to clean the palm and continue doing this once a week until these little bastards are gone. Isolate this plant if there are any others nearby. If there are plants nearby, check them for signs of infestation."
121711,t3_imo3ay,"Sent as a gift, the gravel is glued down and there’s no drainage hole. Will it be okay like this? Should I remove it, if so how?","It will harm the plant. I have never personally removed them but I see a few suggestions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/houseplants/comments/ej6zy6/any_advice_on_how_to_remove_the_glued_in_fake/) (and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/succulents/comments/7f1ki5/anyone_know_why_the_rocks_super_glued_into_this/)) (and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=GHfTKQmv7X4&amp;feature=emb_title)'s the harli video). Based on the suggestions given I'd probably try to soak it and remove it first, if the glue appears water soluble. I feel like that'd harm the plant the least."
292387,t3_s8ja22,SOS my pathos keeps turning yellow and dropping leaves. I thought it might be overwatered and let it dry out but it made the problem worse. No sign of pests. I’ve had this plant for 3 years and it’s been very happy up until now in this exact spot. Is there any chance of saving it?,Move away from the cold window and cut back the yellowing leaves and vines.
292446,t3_s8n07a,Over the last two months or so my ZZ Plant has started to develop some yellow leaves and they appear to be going brown. He is a nice semi dark corner and I only water him ever 3 weeks. Any ideas?,I haven’t watered mine in like 2 months and it’s happy as a clam. Benign neglect is the way with these

292929,t3_s9yjw6,"Help, I was gone for a some weeks and had nobody to take care of my Tradescantia zebrina has suffered a long time of thirst.. is there a way to save it? Maybe cutting off a few inches of the healthy parts for babies?","These guys prop hella easy, you can cut the lowest living part off and then divide up the pieces, put them in water, boom. That’s actually recommended for tradescantias every now and again anyway when they get too leggy. Just make sure you know where the node is and which way is up on the cuttings, maybe pull back from the window while it’s cold out, and you should be good as new!"
121219,t3_ilxz05,"Soil has been sopping wet for a month, yet the plant is still growing. Worried about root rot, but confused as to why it seems to be healthy?",Do you have a good draining mixture? I would def worry about rot and mold. It shouldn't stay sopping wet for a month even without a drainage hole unless you used like mud for the soil or put like a liter or two of water in there
292673,t3_s98q3x,Monstera Adasonii - hello there! my leaves keep yellowing but I couldn‘t find any pests but the new growth is also a little bit damaged. any thoughts on it?,Adansonii run nutrient deficient. Fertilize. If new growth is damaged it could be pest problems or inconsistent watering or lack of humidity.
292684,t3_s9amcx,"I inherited this Thanksgiving cactus mid to late last year. It had 3 stems in this tiny pot, so when I replaced its awful soil, I gave one away. These 2 have bloomed and apparently are blooming again, however I haven't noticed new leaf growth. Am I doing something wrong or is just not the season?","I see aerial roots, schlumbergeras grow those when they're thirsty to try to absorb water from the air. A slightly larger pot would probably be better for it, they don't have huge roots but too small pots will contrict root growth and then it can absorb water and nutrients. They normally grow in the spring and summer. If you want it to grow now, try small amounts of fertiliser, or repot in fresh soil mixed with orchid bark and perlite. The soil and bark will have fertilser added to them"
292688,t3_s9b6tp,My mum had to look after my monestera for a month and it's came back with furry soil! What is it/what do I do to fix this?,I would repot 😮
121007,t3_ilmv09,Help! My monstera adansonii is sad. Leaves seem thin and papery and yellowing in spots. Even stems look like they’re yellowing. New leaves are small and point down. What’s wrong with her?,Yellowing is a sign of lack of Nitrogen. Plant probably just needs a good feed.
120911,t3_ilix7h,first time plant owner! not sure what plant this is or what’s causing it to yellow. am I supposed to cut the dead bits off?,"What sort of light is this plant getting? It looks as though it’s getting burnt. 
I would also cut the dead leaves off from the base with a sharp clean pair of scissors."
298083,t3_soux4y,My son’s plant. I bought it for my son’s 4th bday last September from a grocery store. We have been watering it together. Maybe 2-3 times a week with the sprayer in the second picture. Are we watering it too frequently?,"Is that an air plant / Tillandsia? 

If it is, you can mist every day, but what you do not want, is for the bottom to get wet or have water pool in between the leaves or it will rot.

I mist mine upside down with a very fine spray every day. They sit on top of fine gravel, but never directly IN the gravel. 

Pop it on top of that rock in the terrarium and that will protect the bottom. :)"
105617,t3_hzq1eu,Pilea (on the left) stopped growing after repot while one of her pups (on the right) is thriving (almost overgrowing her mom + full of its own pups also growing). How do I get her mom back up to speed?,Update: repotted to a shallower pot (identical to the one on the right) and no improvements so far :(
105398,t3_hzh6bk,"My girl’s leaves are crispy and curled but every time I water it just sits there in the pot without soaking in. Going to report today, what kind of soil and what kind of plant is she?",It could be a humidity issue too. Fittonias need lots and lots of humidity
91694,t3_hjbnd3,"My peperomia rotundifolia has turned yellow? I think it might have bern watered too much, as a friend has cared for it. It‘s in a north facing window. Will it return to normal again?

However, since it’s last watering it’s dropping leaves like CRAZY without even being touched. Is this a sign it’s on its way to dying?",This happens with mealybugs on jade plants. There are likely to be bugs in the roots. If it keeps getting worse you might have to decapitate the plant and re-root in completely fresh soil.
93417,t3_hlq6yg,Guys my jade has been dropping leaves suddenly since last 3 days. It's at least 7-8 leaves everyday.

I waited a week before I tried to give them water, but it just runs right through the soil... All of them had healthy roots left. Is there something else I should be doing?",Did you remove rotting roots before replanting? Did you use better draining mix? Did you wait to water it after replanting?

I tried cleaning it with cotton swabs and rubbing alcohol as much as I could &amp; I placed it under quarantine to avoid the spread to my other plants. Can this be treated or should I return it to the store?,"Return it, it's not worth the trouble. Buy a new one that isn't infested."
92847,t3_hktixp,"First time buying from Facebook—wondering if I got sent a sick plant or if it got sick in transit. Either way, advice on how to get her back going again?","Looks like too much sun if it came that way.

92105,t3_hjwrwm,Canna indica shows signs of thirst but the soil is still moist. It's been awfully hot these days (95-104 F) and standing in direct sun. Does it need more water?,"It is curling up its leaves to slow down evaporation. I would check the soil and if its dry water it well. You can also check by the weight of your pot.

Looks healthy and nice.

Might just be to much heat, can see some sunburn damage. Would put it in a cooler spot."
91949,t3_hjn5lr,"I order a few days ago about my philo not doing well and leaves turning yellow and dying. I took the advice I got here and looked under the hood. Looks pretty rootbound. Is this what’s likely causing the stress to the plant? Can I trim roots back, split the whole plant or something else?",Repot this into a larger pot size. That should do the trick.
304836,t3_ta9z5x,"About 2 days after buying, one of my Sanseviera Boncels turned white. The other ones still look healthy. What happened?",Fungus rot from overwatering. Get it out of that soil/pot and into some appropriate succulent soil.

93765,t3_hmacf4,"Pothos is sad. Yellowing droopy leaves and sort of transparent. I water once a week &amp; mist it 3x weekly, but maybe not enough water?",That’s a sign of too much water. A pothole will start to drop slightly when it is thirsty. Let it tell you when it needs water
303967,t3_t7kxkz,What is wrong with this plant? He was in a bigger pot so I replanted in a smaller pot. Will he ever stand up straight?,"Looks like he's maybe leaning towards the sun from that window. If you have a dabbled spot beneath the window it may straighten up and fly right, so to speak. Chances are it won't develop new growth on the bare stems though, so you may want to consider chopping and propping!"
303583,t3_t6jofy,My baby rubber plant was happy for about a year but now the leaves are going very pale and no new growth. I haven't changed anything except seeing if it would like a bit more light over the last week. Any ideas?,"Are you fertilizing?

95788,t3_hox3l1,I repotted this moon cactus in better soil after a month after buying on clearance at Home Depot. Will he make it?,"It should be ok, just keep in mind that these guys are more or less temporary fascinations.  The top part cannot feed itself so it is grafted on to that green part for the benefit of the photosynthesis.  One problem is that the top part is suited to dryer climates and the bottom is a jungle tree cacti, so overwatering the bottom can lead to the scion (moon bit) splitting open.  So don't be too sad if it doesn't seem to thrive or grow; it's not really meant to.  I have one that I ripped the top off when it stated to go bad... now the green part is trailing off of my shelf."
95667,t3_hospez,"Monstera lower leaves yellowing and sad... I separated them into different pots months ago and this is just happening now, so I'm pretty sure it's not a pest.

What’s going on!???,"How often do you water it? Brown leaves usually mean too much sun, and plants can also curl their leaves like that too to protect from the sun. Move it to a shader location."
94712,t3_hnglgl,"what’s going on with my furry feather Calathea?

I treated it for root rot with hydrogen peroxide mix, then repotted it in an aroid mix and gave it some encouraging words. I know there’s still life in there. Any tips?",Alocasia love warmth and humidity but it’s possible the plant may go into a dormancy from the stress.

305058,t3_tb0vli,"My monstera dubia cutting just randomly died. The stem is fine, thick and very much green. The leaf is brown and crunchy. What happened??","Oh, no! There are a number of possibilities. Is the soil too dry? Was it in direct sunlight? Did it receive too much fertilizer? Did it receive a pest treatment spray?

If the roots are healthy, it should be able to generate new growth provided it has the proper growing conditions.

Good luck!"

When the plant receives appropriate light, the foliage will be suspended such that it won't even touch the edge of the pot. For reference, I keep mine either on an east balcony or in an east window so that they receive direct sun all morning. 

*C. comosum* need to dry completely between waterings. There are two signs that clearly indicate a need for water: The foliage will pale significantly. The leaves will begin to fold in half lengthwise in an effort to conserve moisture. I strongly encourage you to put this is a much smaller pot. I raise these by the dozens *constantly* and I start them in 2.5"" pots. When you repot it, and don't do that until it's ready to be watered, make sure that the soil level is much higher in the pot. The base of the plant won't receive enough light when so low in the vessel. 

Other than that, avoid fluoride. Best of luck!

My grandmother got this plant last June, I believe, and it looked very healthy then. We proceeded to keep it in full sun when able, but it's leaves seemed to slowly grow more yellow over time. Two stayed green while two turned yellow and ultimately died. After a while I didn't see it. 

By late December I found the plant hiding in a broom closet in her garage. Since it was pretty cold (probably around 10-20 degrees F) and since she seemed to have abandoned it, I took him home. After he acclimated to the temp in the house, I watered him and he seemed to perk up. It's green leaves rose while it's dead ones remained how they were. I kept him in indirect sun since I had assumed putting him somewhere in full sun after sitting in a dark closet for so long would possibly hurt him. As time went on the green leaves began turning yellow, too. I proceeded to move him to varying areas with different degrees of light to see if it was a light problem. I don't like to think I over watered it at all since I usually waited a week or so to water it.

98254,t3_hrxuhj,it's....tall? My rock plant doesn't look like the pictures and I'm not sure what's going wrong. I water it once a month and it gets a lot of direct sun in the morning. what do?,Some succulents stretch out when they're not getting enough sun. Maybe the morning sun isnt enough for it. Im no expert but i think that might be it. Hopefully someone else gives you advice. Try posting on r/succulents. :)
301560,t3_sztrqk,"Just pulled ficus elastica out of pot of leca it’s been in for approx 2 weeks, white stuff and clear smell of mould. Currently transferring it from soil, it’s a small plant, bout 8 inches tall with only 2 leaves. Suggestions on what to do here?","Why on earth would you put a rubber plant in clay balls, if not running a hydroponic system?

These guys are happy in almost any type of soil, cactus mix is a little better since it should drain more quickly.

Choose a pot just big enough to contain the roots, with a little room for growth, but please, don't use expanded clay aggregate in water without a hydroponic setup. You can add the clay balls to the bottom of the pot or mix some in with the soil, but personally, I stopped using them entirely in pots and now, only as a layer in the bottom of some terrariums."
126502,t3_iu0jw8,Hoya Carnosa Compacta. Leaves in the middle of two stems have been yellowing and falling off. The leaves closest to the yellow leaves are wrinkling. Is this a result of a pest or bacterial infection?,"Hi! I typically grow cacti and succulents but this is my first hoya. For the past three months I’ve noticed the leaves in the middle of these two stems have been slowly turning yellow and falling off. The leaves further down the stem are still plump and a vibrant green, but the leaves closest to the yellowing leaves are starting to wrinkle. The clump in the back is vibrant and pump and is not experiencing any problems. It sits in bright indirect light for most of the day and I water once every 2-3 weeks, or once I  notice the leaves in the clump in the back start to wrinkle on the underside. I tend to underwater my plants so I do not think it’s an issue of overwatering.

At first I thought it might be a nutrient deficiency but it was repotted into fresh well draining soil that has a mixture of perlite and orchid bark.

I welcome any recommendations and tips!"

Any advice on how to best help this lil guy make it?,"Things are pretty dire, but I have successfully rehabbed a blue Java this way;

Trim off all of the dead/drying material.  Inspect the roots as best as you can WITHOUT disturbing them too much.  Cut the bottom off of a 2 liter bottle, or something equivalent that you can put over this thing to keep it from actually losing any moisture.  The next step I believe to be one of the most important ones....get some sort of heating pad, and wrap that pot in it, wrap a towel around that to help it hold heat.  Keep your soil temps around 90 degrees Fahrenheit .  Lots and lots and LOTS of sun.  If the soil manages to dry a little, water sparingly to keep it moist and using a liquid diluted fertilizer to give it a little extra nutrients.  Bananas are tough, but this one may not recover.

Many plants do this to attract beneficial insects. Pull the plant out of the pot, if the roots are mushy, brown, falling apart, or crisp all over then it may be root rot. The surface roots on this plant look fine so a cutting would be easy if the roots are rotten.

Have you watered it since? When they droop like that, it's usually either shock or the roots not working well (waterlogged usually if it's right after transplantation). Do you have a picture of the pot? 

Common mistakes are usually overpotting, poor soil drainage, or overloving (messing with it, watering, checking roots). If it's in appropriate soil, has bright indirect light, and a food sized pot, I would not mess with it. I definitely would not change the media as that could shock it more.

I am not sure of the variety as they come in many shades /colours. It is an outdoor plant and is a hardy perennial so in cold climates it will die down in winter and lose many of its leaves. The long bits are old flower stalks- the flowers are pretty but small and the plant is grown mainly for its foliage. I don’t know about in Denmark but in the UK we have an insect called a vine weevil which lays its larvae in the soil so it’s grubs can feed on the plant roots as it grows. Heucheras in pots are their absolute favourite! If it starts to do very poorly or top growth wilts , check the roots to see if they have been munched.

Use a toothpick, chopstick, pencil, or whatever is lying around to push a wick up into the drainage hole of each pot, then leave them on a dish rack or baking rack over the sink or the tray to drain overnight, or at least until water completely stops dripping from the wicks. You can use anything for the wicks - pieces a shoelace, strips of old t-shirt, even toothpicks will work. The wicks need only be 2-3 inches long, and they should hang freely from the drainage holes (as in, the free end of the wick should not touch the bottom of the sink/tray and should not touch the surface of any standing water that has drained out of the pots).

If any of the pots have multiple drainage holes (not just 1 in the middle), prop those pots tilted at a 45° angle and insert the wick into the drainage hole at the lowest point of the pot."

If your soil is growing mold, it's likely excessively damp, which is perfect for gnats and also very bad for succulents.

Let your soil dry out and then leave it that way for awhile before watering again. In the future, water infrequently and when it comes time to repot, use a fast-draining potting mix. Your succulents will appreciate it, and it'll help get rid of gnats."

Anyone know why this is happening? Is it natural because it's is the beginning of winter?","Without knowing the details of your care routine, I can offer a few suggestions: 

Always test your soil with a moisture meter before watering. You want the soil to be dry between waterings. 

Keep your room humidity at least at 50%. Plants with huge leaves like yours lose a LOT of moisture from their leaves if kept in a low-humidity environment, so a humidifier may be needed if your living space has dry air. 

Try watering only with distilled water instead of tap water. 

Avoid fertilizing or re-potting in the winter. 

Try to keep air temps in the upper 60’s if you can, at least. Anything below 65 is “danger zone” for a lot of tropical plants. 

Gently wipe the leaves once a week with fresh water to remove dust and pests. Do not mist. 

Hope this helps!"
276101,t3_qrsi2e,i’m so sad my monstera has thrips and all this time i thought i had another gnat infestation. how do i go about this?,"When I first noticed thrips on one of my big-leaved plants it was still a bit early. Not sure at what point you are at, but here is what I did:

* Got a damp paper towel and wiped each leaf clean on front and back.
* Made sure thrips weren't on other plants (luckily they weren't)
* Throughout the day, I would check my leaves and if I saw a thrip I would immediately wipe it away with a damp paper towel
* Continued to do this for a couple of days
* On day three I finally got some Neem oil and made a mixture that I lightly sprayed on each leaf front and back - then I wiped the leaves down again with a damp paper towel
* I did this repeatedly and checked back throughout the day and following days to ensure all thrips were gone

I luckily work from home, though, so it might be a bit harder to be so diligent. All I know is that once you see thrips, you gotta get rid of them fast.

Good luck to you!"
156771,t3_kdknwc,"Monstera cutting started to rot, am I better off just replanting in soil and hoping I can save it this way?","You can save this! Using a clean scalpel, cut off the rotting ends. Wait for them to dry and seal them with a bit of wax (drip it onto the ends and up the sides a little so moisture can’t get in there or dip straight into a candle) 
If the root is also rotted, also cut it off. You can also use a hydrogen peroxide solution to soak it in before replanting, but you’ll need to google the concentration because I can’t remember atm. 

I’d pot it in either perlite or sphagnum moss, shut te whole thing in a plastic bag if you can and stick it under a light!

The other herbs on the sill are doing well for the most part. Is my thyme a goner?,"It looks like you might have a fungus or infestation. I notice some white stuff on the dead leaves, or holes, but I can’t tell which. I also notice some water on the leaves, and on the living leaves, some little white flecks. 

Here’s what I would do: I’d lob it all off, close to the soil, and let it get a little dormant. Then start watering again and see if it comes back. 

When you water your herbs, water close the the dirt so the leaves stay dry. Occasionally add nitrogen through adding compost or a fertilizer. 

Weekly treatments with neem oil prevent fungus and bugs. 

Alternatively, you can try rooting the viable stem. [Here is a good article. ](https://learningherbs.com/skills/herbs-from-cuttings/) If you root it, use clean dirt and a new or sterile pot."

140637,t3_jip6ks,"Help please! Fiddle leaf: Checked roots (third pic) &amp; no root rot, but still getting dark brown spots at base of leaves, and little black dots - Two different issues? What could this be?","Hi I’m struggling to diagnose the issue with my fiddle leaf fig! This is my very first plant which I got during the peak of the pandemic so I’m hoping to keep it alive 🤧🤧

Went through mealy bugs three weeks ago (growth was stagnating &amp; new leaves stopped getting bigger) and was actively spraying a non-phytotoxic biopesticide (diluted in water), once a day for five days straight. After spraying the biopesticide, it seemed to recover and started looking more moisturised, darker green and leaves growing bigger.

However I’ve noticed in the past week, little black dots both on the top of the leaf and the bottom. I was wiping each leaf down with alcohol wipes on top of the biopesticide &amp; was wondering if that could be a chemical burn or a reaction to the spray. Admittedly I was spraying it down aggressively.

However, in the past three days I’ve noticed brown spots getting larger - they start at the base of each leaf, but are also around the edges. I figured the only way to figure out if it was indeed root rot was to check the roots - they all looked healthy though, no black or mushy roots at all. 

So I’m struggling to figure out what could be stressing the plant. I have been moving it around and putting it under a grow light since winter is approaching, so there has been a change in lighting conditions. But the watering has stayed the same.. Does anyone have any thoughts?"

I also have mine under grow lights for 12 hours a day but that’s because my living room stays pretty dark in winter. Dracaenas can be sensitive to tap water. If you are using tap water, try letting it sit out for at least 24 hours to allow some of the chlorine etc to evaporate out of the water. Or use filtered water."
132196,t3_j3qx2z,"Does this Philodendron Mamei have a fungus? I purchased it recently. It already had some of the yellowing and the tears, but the seller told me that's due to transport stress which seemed plausible to me. Now it shows those yellow dots though. I've never dealt with fungus before - what do I do?","Yellowing leaves on a philodendron are an indication that the plant is getting too much water. When watering, philodendrons should be kept moist, but not overly soaked. Avoid standing water, and allow the soil on and around the plant to become dry between watering 

Philodendron are commonly grown as houseplants. Because they grow in partial shade and indirect light, they can be more susceptible to powdery mildew fungus than plants that grow in full sun. Powdery mildew appears as white powdery or cottony patches on the tops of leaves or stems.


Other tips: Philodendron are tropical plants, so higher humidity will promote lush growth and shiny foliage. It will tolerate lower humidity levels, but misting the plant regularly will help it thrive.


Philodendron do best in loose, well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They will grow in 100% sphagnum peat moss. Soilless mixtures such as peat-vermiculite or peat-perlite are also satisfactory. Philodendron can be propagated by tip and leaf bud cuttings. Personally I use a mix of potting soil, bark/orchid mix, perlite, sphagnum moss, and activated biochar."

130589,t3_j0zo6v,Bought this Best Boy tomato plant as a seedling in late spring. These pics show the secondary stem (main stem split after rainstorm) which grew high but only has about 5 flowers total. I know it’s too late to fix this year but does anyone have any tips I could use for next time?,"How deep is your pot?

Tomatoes have extensive root systems, if you want an abundance of fruit, give it a big deep pot. A 5 gallon bucket would be the minimum but if you want one plant to give you a bunch, I'd get more like 20 gallons. Yes. 20 🤣 especially if you're growing indeterminate. If you choose an indeterminate, get a 20 gal pot if you wanna use what you have, look at determinate cultivars.


You'll want to make sure they're in full sun and that you prune all the suckers. Any suckers can be rooted in water for more plants if you wanted but you want those gone so that the plant can focus on fruit. 

I like to keep two main stems going and train those up but I grow in a raised bed so you might be better off letting just one main stem go. They're heavy feeders so make sure you're watering and feeding regularly. I microdose once a week with a liquid fertilizer during the growing season.

You also want to think about type when container growing. Not all types are suited for containers.  Best boy is one of them. They're....wily as fuck lol and prefer to have a LOT OF GROWING SPACE. so next season, look at different varieties.

Rareseeds.com is my favorite for heirloom seeds and has a ton of variety. If you wanna start from seed, start indoor early around Feb. You can hot house it with a pot and a plastic baggy. When you get your seedling outdoors, after hardening, I actually like to remove most of the bottom leaves, leaving only...eh...4 sets of leaves max? And then burying a fair amount of the stem. It'll encourage it to throw out even more roots. 

If you have space for a raised bed...your tomato will go insane lol. I did one yellow pear this season and it's now 10' tall and 15' wide...🤦‍♀️ I've had to train it vertical and then horizontal and it's still going strong lol."

Best practice for pruning?",I would recommend searching “how to treat thrips” on YouTube. There are a number of great videos with different preferred methods that will be able to go much more in depth than my comment. i personally live in the subtropics and just throw my plants outside for a few weeks when they get thrips 😊but the main thing to remember with thrips is that there is a cycle of adults who lay eggs who then hatch. I believe it’s about 3 weeks so you will likely need to treat the plant more than once to stop this cycle. Unfortunately they are one of the trickiest houseplants to shake.
130476,t3_j0up7o,"Pothos not doing correct pothos things. She used to be much more full, but had steadily lost leaves due to yellowing, which I assumed was because she needed a new pot, but pulled her out and she still had room, and roots looked healthy.

I'd cut off any dead leaves as they are using energy that could be going to the healthy leaves. It's normal for the older leaves to die off this time of year as the plant goes dormant.

Remove from soil, wash roots, wash leaves and stems, keep in water (lukewarm) for a min of an hour while you prep new soil. Repot, cause they can sit in the soil.

285492,t3_rmzwya,All of my alocasia’s and calocasia’s have these. I’ve tried insecticidal soap and thrip spray. Any recommendations?,Thrips for sure. Don’t know why your spray has not worked. I would physically remove any visible bugs (unless there are millions) with a cotton bud dipped in surgical spirit. You could also try showering the leaves to blast them off. Then nuke them with your pesticide of choice.

Any advice how to save?,"Well I wouldn’t say it really has any roots but those look pretty far gone. I’d reccomend trying to reroot it, try giving the end a fresh cut, cut until all flesh looks healthy. Being as this is a thick stem I’m not sure what way you can cut it but I would avoid crushing or lacerating the stem. You can plop it in water which has a pretty high chance of working but ficus tend to root better in perlite for me. They do really good rooting in leca after the first roots start forming."

Mine is smaller so I was able to take it out of the soil, clean and trim dead brown mushy roots. The stems was starting to rot too so I cut off some parts of it. Put it in water (only bc I was so tired at that point) but then put it in leca balls for now."

If the last leaf falls, will it regrow leaves if the stem and roots are still okay?",The soil looks a bit too compact. Generally Hoyas like grittier soil and to dry up completely between waterings. You should water when the leaves have lost their rigidity.
283899,t3_rh6hpo,Losing approx. one leaf per week from the bottom up…. Has been alive and in the same spot with the same care since February (11 months). Should I do something differently? Maybe repot?,"Very probably root rot. I would cut off the top and replant it.

Has it been the same since February, or is that just how long you've had it in that spot with that care? If it has been doing the same since February it's not root rot, root rot is much faster at killing.

It's probably going into dormancy, so it didn't need much water."

Because of their need for the sun, they fare poorly indoors but make great container plants outside! *IF* this is a Canna, it's severely etiolated and needs light ASAP. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/w4QOIUh) are my current 3 who will be going in the ground from the containers this weekend! Those are what they should look like as healthy specimens.

I’d also suggest letting leaves unfurl naturally ( I know it’s tempting) to minimize chances for damage. In terms of all white leaves, of wait to see what colors the plant throws next.

Many online resources say to thoroughly water once a week but I’ve found mine likes to be misted, until the top of the soil/top layer is noticeably wet, every other day or so to boost humidity and keep soil moist. 

For soil I add a little more perlite (20-30% of soil mass) and coco coir (10% of soil mass) to my normal potting mixture which is Espoma’s organic potting mixture. Make sure there’s a drainage hole so roots don’t sit in water. I also cover top with some small rocks to help keep bugs out as well as maintain moisture better.

I wouldn't be concerned about the blotches. Plants do weird stuff sometimes.

Adult thrips can be tiny, skinny black bugs but your plant doesn't look like it has thrips. Thrips suck the chlorophyll out of plant cells, leaving that feeding spot white and giving the plant a weird dusty or mottled appearance. Your plant does not look like that at all. But it's good to be vigilant! I notice thrips on the undersides of leaves first so definitely check them and I would wipe your leaves down with neem oil and a microfiber cloth regularly as a preventative. However, if you do eventually see thrips, neem oil won't be enough to get rid of them effectively.

When you repot, you can mix a slow release systemic insecticide in with your soil to prevent pests (this does not work for spider mites) or you can sprinkle on the top of your soil now. But the easiest thing is to just be vigilant and check your leaves once a week or so."

While you didn't find any root rot, I see broken off roots lying in the soil to the left. The roots likely completely disintegrated.

When you repot the plant in this post, use a VERY SMALL unglazed terracotta pot - only large enough for what is left of the roots. They need a fast draining soil, with excellent drainage to thrive. Root rot will take over if planted in too large a pot.

If that is a dracaena, they have very small and compact root systems, even when 100% healthy. This is an example of a healthy root system: [https://www.nature-and-garden.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dracaena-marginata-roots.jpg](https://www.nature-and-garden.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dracaena-marginata-roots.jpg)"
