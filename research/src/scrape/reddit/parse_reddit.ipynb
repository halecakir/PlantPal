I think it’s rotting from the inside out, likely over watering. Check this link and see if it matches. \\n\\nhttps://www.sublimesucculents.com/root-rot-succulents/  \n",
       "358036  Where is the original post? Is this it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/plantclinic/comments/xgzq5x/constantly\\_brown\\_and\\_yellow\\_ive\\_watered\\_more\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/plantclinic/comments/xgzq5x/constantly_brown_and_yellow_ive_watered_more_and/)?\\n\\nWhile you didn't find any root rot, I see broken off roots lying in the soil to the left. The roots likely completely disintegrated.\\n\\nWhen you repot the plant in this post, use a VERY SMALL unglazed terracotta pot - only large enough for what is left of the roots. They need a fast draining soil, with excellent drainage to thrive. Root rot will take over if planted in too large a pot.\\n\\nIf that is a dracaena, they have very small and compact root systems, even when 100% healthy. This is an example of a healthy root system: [https://www.nature-and-garden.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dracaena-marginata-roots.jpg](https://www.nature-and-garden.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dracaena-marginata-roots.jpg)  \n",
