1884,t3_8h934m,My 9 foot tall tree is feeling a bit frisky since moving to the new house. Anything I can/should do for it to get it through this trying time?,,This is a corn palm dracenea. It looks happy since it's blooming. It can be cut back and will bring if it is too tall to move. You can plant the cut off parts.
219,t3_6lroqv,What's going on with my strawberries? They're all so...wrong. They are in a hanging basket in full sun with regular watering. Zone 6A (?) When I first planted them there was a heavy rain phase for a while. Could that be the culprit?,,"Howdy. This is what strawberries look like when they are poorly pollinated - these are called ""belly buttons"". 

You can try [hand-pollinating them](http://homeguides.sfgate.com/pollinate-strawberry-plants-44492.html) to get better fruit fill."
2170,t3_8nwovp,"This little guy came to me wilted. I'm not sure what the soil is, it was the nursery's mix. I give him a spritz in the morning, but I think I may have accidentally drowned him. I have him in a draining pot inside a non draining pot, and only just realized he was swimming a bit. Fixable?",,"Get it out of the non-draining pot, he doesn't need it.  I would withhold watering for two weeks, or until the pot feels substantially lighter. Establish a regular feeding and watering schedule.  Maybe one feeding per month and if your air is humid, watering *maybe* once every two or three weeks.  If you are in a dry climate like I am, watering once per week might be about right.  For most of my plants I base watering upon the weight of the plant and pot- the lightest pots get a soaking in the sink.  Feel free to spritz it daily- though it will benefit more from a humidifier.  Bright indirect light, rotate it daily a few degrees."

402,t3_6p86i0,"Sorry for the photo, it's night where I am. My aunt told my cousin before she passed to take care of her Gardenia, and now he's stressing because the leaves are curling and yellowing. Any advice?",,"I've never been good with gardenias... and I don't know what you did or didn't do.... but here's advice - the leaf curl could be a sign of pests or the soil has been left too dry. Thoroughly water once a week or until the top inch of dirt becomes dry again and check underside of leaves/branches for strange critters

The yellowing leaf can be a sign of nutrient deficiency usually caused by the soil being to alkaline. pH check your water, and adjust to around 5.0-5.5 before watering to help bring maintain pH. Lemon juice or a tiny bit of pH down solution will help a bit in the short term.  Some sulfur slow-release pellets will probably be your long term solution?"

Are they really gone now or are they just in a new pot? There are probably eggs left in the soil at the very least. Identify the bugs (we may be able to help) and take proper, specific measures to combat them. This will probably include watering less (wait until the top layer of soil dries out), improving airflow (with a gentle fan), and application of beneficial nematodes or some other predator."

796,t3_72p98w,Why is my ZZ drooping? Repotted in June. Plant went through big growth spurt. Am I overwatering? Does less light in winter affect it? Should I stake or tie it somehow?,,Zz plants stems will get longer if grown in low light.  At my nursery the plant while outside in the spring and summer are very tight and have shorter stems.  When I move them inside for the winter I get a few longer stems like yours has.   They are just reaching for light.  My inside lexan greenhouses cut about 50% of the full sunlight while outside I grow them under 30% shade cloth so that’s the difference.  Your plants will be fine.  If you don’t like the longer stems.  You can cut them off and root them though it’s much harder to root them in the colder months.  Good luck with it. 
968,t3_7brgwu,Rhizomes on my ZZ plant rotted away from bad drainage. Washed roots and removed dead tissue. What's next? Can I save it?,,"If there really is no rhizome left, the chances of the large one making it are pretty slim.  However, zzz plants are tough.  I'd plant them all anyway in a nice, well-draining mix and see what happens.  If you haven't already invested in a little 8qt bag of pumice or perlite, please do - adding a little extra to regular potting mix will help you avoid these situations.  Plus, using a mix comprised of nearly half perlite is great for starting cuttings and speeding the root growth of split plants like this.  Just keep up with the watering, the soil will get dry much faster/"

670,t3_6x1sv0,What is wrong with this avocado?? How do I avoid buying ones that will be like this? Also...can I eat it?,,You can eat it but it will be 100% nasty. I'm guessing that it's over-ripe. Try buying a bright green avocado and letting it ripen on your counter for 2 days. That's safer than trying to buy an already-ripe avocado. The fruit should be a little soft but not mushy when you eat it. 
2098,t3_8mhlmk,Serviceberry just transplanted from a pot into ground. Dirt is heavy clay but I surrounded it with compost and a thin layer of mulch. Flowers fell off right away but it started putting out new leaves and branches and berries. Heavy spring rains. Is it drowning? Or is this an infection?,,"Hi, Certified Arborist here

When it comes down to transplanting any tree, it reminds me of moving a pet fish from one container to a bigger one, or vise versa. 

Typically you have to add more water and once you do, you are having to adjust the temperature of the water to match the one of the current fishes water to prevent shock to the fish or to prevent discomfort etc. 

Same with a new tree. But obviously more complex. 

What I would recommend doing is checking the soil PH. See what’s it at on the scale, typically 6.5-7 is ideal.

I just learned you can buy a PH reader like on Home depot or places like those for $10 or so. 

After you’ve determined the Ph level adjust the surrounding soil to make it either more acidic or alkaline to match the 6.5-7 level. 

Hope this helps! "
1889,t3_8hfxe4,Does anyone know what could be causing these brown spots and yellowing leaves on my dracena? Is it just poor drainage/over watering or something more?,,"You have plenty of healthy growth and it's an otherwise strong and healthy plant.

If you look at the medium, the yellow-brown speckles on the surface are probably perlite- which is normally white. What appears to be happening is that salts found in the water are being concentrated in the medium. Moisture evaporates from the surface, leaving behind these salts- which are turning the  perlite yellow-brown.

The presence of more salts makes it harder for the plant to take up water- it has to ""fight"" against those salts to acquire more. But the plant *has* plenty of water, or it would look dry and ratty. But it's fighting the salts. So where it appears are the areas with the highest surface area to mass ratio- the tips. Those get browned. Probably causes the spots, too, if I had to guess.

Your options are:

1) Start watering with rainwater (if you live in an area without significant industrial pollution), distilled water, or reverse osmosis water. Water ""through,"" meaning water comes out the bottom of the pot, reducing salts build-up.

2) Start soaking in a bucket of clean water (as above), and allowing the medium to drain thoroughly.

3) Water with a bit of magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts), which will *help* but not eliminate the salts through cation exchange. You will still need to water ""through,"" as above.

4) Repot. Wash off as much of the old medium as you can, and put into a slightly larger pot with fresh medium.

5) Live with it. This species is a strong grower, and yours looks very good but for the tips and spots. It is not appreciably harmed by the salts."

I think ants may be munching on the leaves (which I'm trying to tackle) but why are the leaves so brown? As you can see the new growth is very healthy (apart from the odd aphid attack) This started before the ant problem.

2165,t3_8nshwo,This papaya plant just arrived... like this. Shipping took a few days. Are the yellow dots due to lack of sunlight? There are a few leaves that are completely yellow instead of healthy green. When should I repot (I know the roots are quite fragile)?,,"Shipping can be rough on plants.  I think putting it in a place where it can thrive for is the best idea.  You should gradually put it back into direct sunlight.

Most soils have plenty of iron, but at reasonably high pH it's locked up in an insoluble form.

Your two solutions are to apply either iron chelates (FeEDTA or FeEDDHA), or to lower the pH of the soil with ammonium sulfate. Some citrus fix-all-in-a-bag do both. Check Home Depot, Lowes, etc."

I know gardenias are finicky so I finally repotted it with fresh soil and spread a bit of coffee grounds on top. Anyone have some bits of wisdom for me?,,"Try with fungicide or neem oil, get rid of the leaves immediately after removing to reduce chance of contamination, although you should treat the entire plant. Provide good air circulation and once the problem subsides, treat to prevent. 

Also, i'd suggest mixing the coffee grounds with the soil fill, not just spread on top. Or ideally use plant food for acid loving plants.

Let it dry out and they will go away.

Little tip: Cacti and succulents aren't native to peat soils, and while peat is cheap, inexpensive, and readily available, it is also not good for C&amp;S in that it holds too much moisture and the pH is all wrong. Use an inorganic mix for succulents: sand, perlite, vermiculite, pumice, and a trace of coir if you absolutely insist on water-holding capacity.

Another common problem on pepper that causes misshapen leaves is broad mites. If this were the case, you'd see the growing point(s) of the the plant showing the most severe symptoms. You usually can't see the mites themselves.

Thrips can also cause misshapen leaves, but you'll usually see a ton of thrips on the plant if the damage is this bad."

1119,t3_7m3w6o,Got this unknown plant from my mom and he doesn’t look great - what’s the best thing I can do for him?,,"It looks rotted at the base. Ponytail palms love to be root locked in small pots, so repotting in a larger pot won't help you. Looks like over watering. Theyre actually considered part of the succulent family so require well draining soil, full soaking with the ability to dry out between waterings and a fair amount of light. I water mine once a week, and the one that i have more in indirect light i just monitor the soil moisture making sure it dries out before i water it again. I would try a deeper pot next time, the diameter looks appropriate for the base size of your plant, and line the bottom with gravel and activated charcoal if you dont have a pot with a drainage hole. Cactus soil is a must. "

Got two of these plants from my boyfriend's grandma last month. She said she doesn't know what they are but they are virtually impossible to kill. Yet, the leaves have started yellowing and some of them are torn. I water them every few days and have them in a south facing window. This morning I noticed something on the stems. I don't know if it's something normal or if it is some type of bug or disease (a quick search has me wondering if it's plant scales?). Any help is appreciated!","Yellowing pothos leafs means bad watering, could mean either too often, or too little.  In your case, too often.

Watering every few days is way too much.
I water mine every 12 days.  Of course it depends on how much sun it gets, humidity etc.. 

I would change to every 14 days, and monitor the soil, adjust the time frame as necessary.  The top 50% of the soil should be pretty dry before you water again.  Then water it good.

When in doubt, watering less often is ALWAYS better than watering too often.  Plants can recover from lack of water, watering too much kills them.

EDIT: In regards to your stems, looks normalish to me... I don't know the technical explanation of what it is, but mine has a bit of it, and its been healthy and growing for years.

Ferns typically like to stay moist. Terracotta dries out faster than a glazed or plastic pot. You're probably making watering more challenging by using this pot. When type of pot was the fern in originally?

Lots of plants dislike being moved. They get used to the conditions of one location and go into shock when moved somewhere else. Did you move it? Transplant shock also exists for similar reasons.

I need a clearer picture to tell exactly what it is, generic names can be confusing (I thought of a viburnum until i clicked it). 

Most plants need at least a tiny amount of drying out between watering.  Maybe only a day,  but mainly because people overwater far more readily than underwatering. It causes root rot, so very few plants actually like constantly wet roots.  Now depending on how you water it it may be fine,  but more often than not letting it dry out helps.  A decent rule of thumb is to stick finger in soil a knuckle or two to feel if it's dry.  Eventually you can tell by sight or weight of the pot. Or just touching surface.

We moved into a new house in zone 8a this spring with two awesome Red Oaks in front (Shumard, I believe).  We have had an extremely cool summer for Texas, especially since Hurricane Harvey.  Maybe the trees are just confused and think that it's fall already.

But I'm terrified it could be oak wilt, or some bacterial infection.  I did some pruning in late spring, and a little more in the early summer, which makes me concerned possibly the oak wilt fungus infiltrated the tree at that time.

In the linked image gallery, the last photo shows that even a little volunteer sapling near the base has the spots, too.

The pruning I did opened up the inside of the trees a lot more, so there's a chance this is leaf scorch from leaves that weren't expecting the extra sun.

Brown tips can be many different things, but often it’s because of ‘shallow’ watering, where you don’t fully get all the roots. Conversely, if you water too much, this can damage roots as well, leaving them overly thirsty. 

Often times it is due to lack of humidity. Many houseplants come from tropical climates. So if you live in a northern climate and have had to run the heat all winter, this leaves everything dry. I like in MN and most of my plants are starting to show signs of stress from lack of humidity. 

The buildup of salts from water and too much fertilizer can also brown leave tips. Maybe try using distilled water and see if there’s an improvement. 

Overall, plants are like people: they ain’t perfect. If the plant seems healthy overall, a few brown leaf tips aren’t much to stress about. "

It’s soil was completely damp for the past 3 days. Began to notice marks 3 days ago. is there anything I can do or is this normal?",,It may be that the soil is staying wet for prolonged periods - you said it was 'completely damp' for 3 days. Try letting it dry out a little before watering so the soil doesn't become oversaturated.
2320,t3_8q7y6p,Can someone please help me figure out what this is on my Peperomia obtusifolia? It’s only on the newer leaves. Is it possibly scale?,,"Yes, it is possibly scale. Do you have  hand lens or something to magnify so you can look at the spots more closely? Most scales will be slightly raised and have a texture like fingernails sort of - striated like that. They could be colored like tortoiseshell and have a very slight shine to them. If you have a needle, you could pull up  the edge and if they come off like tiny caps, they are scale. Might be hard to see the actual insect.

I love hort oil for houseplants with scale or mealybug. Very low dilution, and you'll need a few apps, probably a week or so apart. Choose low humidity, not too hot days to do it (if it is indeed scale).

ETA when I zoom in, those spots look like they are pits rather than raised. If that's the case, might be a disease. You can try taking a leaf into your garden center - an independent, not a box store, typically. More horty people there."

1887,t3_8habu6,What are these bugs I found on some of my plants? How do I safely get rid of them and prevent them from spreading?,,"Mealybugs, looks like. They're a pain. I'd start by rinsing the plant and physically removing as many as you can. There are various treatments depending on how chemical-y you want to get.  I like using systemic granular insecticides (e.g., imidocloprid) for things like mealybugs and scale because they're just such a pain. But you can't have critters or children touching the soil, so if that's a possibility I wouldn't do that. There are neem oil sprays that I believe work for mealybugs as well and are much less toxic than imidocloprid, although they're still not something you'd want to wipe all over your face. Check out your local garden store and read the labels, they should say what bugs they work on."

Its dry

I've had it for 3 days

I have not repotted it, following advice from the greenhouse to wait a few months

I bought it with bone dry soil, watered it the night I brought it home and yesterday after discovering it all dried out. I drenched and let the soil drain well

Light is LED full spectrum lights that are indirect. I didn't want to fry it so I put it inbetween the two.

Pot is decoration for now, its still in the plastic pot it came in. They both have drainage holes

Straight from sheltered indoors out into the wind and sun?

Also, as robotjonny noted, you definitely need drainage holes in the bottom if you didn't already drill those in the bottom.

As for pruning, have a look at http://www.instructables.com/id/Pruning-Tomatoes-for-Maximum-Yield/
Some varieties shouldn't be pruned, but if this is the case it would be noted on the seed packs or website.

Larger suckers make great cuttings, and tomato cuttings root easily. Just stuff it in a flower pot with dirt, and make sure to water it and not let it dry out. 
The cuttings will look sad for a week or two, and then start to look healthier.

If your plants are just in shock from moving, and not waterlogged, try moving them to a location that is a little more sheltered from the wind if possible. They'll probably recover in a couple of weeks if this is the problem.

In the future, when moving plants out, it is a good idea to do it slowly. Start with 15min or so the first day, and then extend the time over multiple days before moving completely. Cloudy, mostly wind free days are best when starting."

It's very difficult to figure out how much and when to water with them. Terracotta pots are the best type of pots , in my opinion, because they drain and allow the dirt to dry out between waterings.

* Have been spraying it with Daconil fungicide per the instructions, which I'm also using on my tomato and cucumber plants and they are not showing similar symptoms
* The symptom of this kind of leaf yellowing have only shown up very recently, maybe a week ago. I applied tomato fertilizer a few weeks ago and was afraid I used too much, but this yellowing doesnt look like the typical signs of fertilizer burn I have seen online
* Pot is probably 5 gal and ~12"" deep with adequate drainage
